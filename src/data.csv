Rather, we should make strides to ensure that racism in America and specifically the history of anti-Black racism is taught in schools. This could be in the form of federal curriculum mandates. Through education of past mistakes, we can hopefully ensure that systems of discrimination do not occur in the future.","Restructure the systems: There are a multitude of systems in our society that are so deeply rooted in this that it would possibly be more effort to fix them than it is to remove them and replace them with something new that addresses the old problems while also trying to prevent new issues. Take the prison system for example, due to financial incentives to have people in jail, corporations and certain government systems want prisoners, incentivizing the arrest of more people. This could be done by removing the involvement of private companies and removing the use of prisoners for profit so it is not seen as a waste of money to not have a full jail. There would be push back and lobbying by the corporations that profit from the prison system, but the overall effect would make a huge difference.","Hire a more diverse group of people into the teams that write and teach algorithms. Raise the incentive for people of color to join those fields so there will be more diversity. In order to fix the issue of people making racially biased decisions, the system at large must be changed. This is because people often inherit their biases from the systems that they grew up with, which often have a racist history. These biases do not just appear out of thin air, but rather they are indicicative of the historical injustices that have occured as a result of our institutions being utilized as weapons for discrimination.","With emphasis on racist algorithms, which inherited the bias from its creators or data points, we can indulge in the process of third party scrutinisation and having a diverse group of people in the team of creators. This will incorporate the perspective of the people of color and respective alterations/additions. Another solution would be to test the prototype over a diverse data set to reduce the bias before releasing it to the larger public. This would help in identifying the error in the earlier stages and give the creators a window to make the required changes. There could be changes required for the set data points used, the programming, machine learning etc. the required changes.	This argument can be extended to any product that is being released for the larger public.",15,55,15,15,"Solving systemic racism is less of a monetary issue and more of an issue surrounding the willingness of people to change their biases at the individual level. The majority of the funding went to structural racism because there would be a lot of funds needed in reworking the prison system. Thus, 100 Billion USD should be enough for the programs themselves, but it might take more in order to solve the issue of systemic racism as a whole."
9/24/2021 17:48:40,B1-2,"We can't change history but we can educate Americans on the history of racism as well as its impacts on our society and other parts of our daily lives. By educating Americans on racism and its effects, we can also avoid repeating these racist actions in the future. We also need to make sure that the history of racism is not suppressed and instead, acknowledged. We can hold workshops and discuss the history of racism, create social media accounts and websites to teach others. The big idea is to raise awareness, teach people to reflect on their actions, and to point out the importance of catching and calling yourself out when you discriminate against someone and/or act on your prejudice of someone. Even by making small changes in your circle, collectively we can make a big change.","Society and the structures which make it up are currently racially biased in a majority. To change society's view on racism as a whole you need to make changes to society which will begin to switch people's personal values, some of which have been passed down for generations. Structural racism is a large problem which is within many parts of society today, it will be necessary to change all of these inequalities, ie a police officer being raised to discriminate against black americans and then going out and arresting black americans more often even when that person may not be doing anything wrong. To change this structural racism you will need to train officers not to discriminate against someone's race and specifically arrest someone based on the crimes they have committed. Also besides fixing structures in society which contain a larger amount of racial bias we need to have schools create a curriculum to teach children about race from a young age in order to try and start a new generation of children, most of which who may keep said values for the rest of their life and in turn teaching their children, starting a new cycle on less racism. ","At a human level to address racism, increased activism must take place to allow for people to understand what racism is and how it affects those around them. By opening up conversations on race, stigma around the topic can be lifted and  conversations can flow. By taking steps to help everyone understand how race affects their day to day life  changes can be made to allow for more equity and fairness among humans. Having safe and brave spaces for people to engage in these conversations would go a long way.","Technology is bound to advance at an even quicker rate and it should be made sure that this technology isn’t allowed to support already racist power structures and people. The more people that understand the technology in their daily lives and around them, the less likely it is for systems in power to make technology racist as they run the chance of negative publicity from their consumers. We can educate people about the racial bias in the technology around by testing all software for biases and publicly publishing the results.. This would allow people to make educated decisions on what services they use, as well as have a good knowledge in  indicating the racial basis of any technological system. This should reveal any inherent basis within the technology.",15,40,25,20,"Money isn't really the biggest factor, time is. Money is a very very  important tool towards the elimination of racism however things will take time to change. The money used towards education, restructuring of services, and creation of services will take time to be implemented and especially with the pushback from people in power who have even more money, it will be a long battle. Money is important, but time is king. Based on our current plan, 100 billion was spread and used, but we don’t know how much we might actually need in the future because of time."

When the Europeans first arrived in America, the Native Americans still had this land. It was then taken from them and never given back. Then a few decades later, slave labor began to boom around the world which led to the slave trade being prevalent in America. This led to the import of Black slaves from Africa and they were immediately seen as just slaves and not even human. It is important to educate ourselves and the next generation about the history and acknowledge it so that we can end the racism that has been embedded into society.","As racism is built into our society as a whole, it is no wonder that the people who live within it are influenced by this fact. We should stand by the fact that the changes that would need to come would be involved at an early age, and treated as a serious topic. Often, we see in many school systems within our education struggling to keep up to date with both the past and present. Many could argue that most don’t take America's negative history seriously. Thus, it is a requirement that we change the education system to allow for a more serious environment about the topic of things like racism. Not just any history though, there should be a particular emphasis on the bad of our history, and it’s impacts into the modern day. If people are taught from a young age what our nation is and has been, it should only go on to further aid the fight against the cycle of racism over time. ","Self-introspection is one of the key factors to eliminate racism at a structural level. This will help us look at ourselves and examine our own biases and how they impact our lives and other people's lives.It will broaden our horizons and help us get a deeper understanding of our privileges. Additionally, the idea of polling communities for information could also allow for insights into how the systems are within the country.",Our solution is to have multiple committees review each of the data that is being learned by the machine and determine which data is reasonable to be accepted. A third-party of diverse groups will be vital to analyzing the data so that it can minimize the racial bias. The data will be passed again through multiple committees so that the bias will decrease. This is similar to the process of how a bill is passed within the US government. ,15,40,15,30,"We don’t believe 100 Billion is enough to address the problem we are trying to solve. In order to see if it actually works, we need time and time is money. We feel as if a yearly budget dedicated to change could be implemented if these concepts do well.

Thus, using the old data will definitely cause racism. Any programs that are built on the history of structural racism should be abandoned and (if necessary) replaced with unbiased versions.","•	One thing that we can change is the level of education that we receive, there should not be one school that is better than another and everyone should have the right ability to go to school and not give it up due to economic issue (maybe making college/ school free). Also, not because one school prefer one race over the other and so accept that one group more and take away the right of the other group to attend this school. Everyone should be in the same level in terms of education. For college acceptance we can hide everything that might expose our identity from the university and just give them a list a number that represent each person other than our names and all other information since that can also expose our race/ other which can affect their decision of accepting or not.","•	The people most aware of racial biases tend to be those most affected by them, so including a diverse body to review potentially biased decisions would increase the chances that biases can be caught and rectified before they become seriously problematic. They do not know they are doing racist things. In this case, some feedbacks will be needed about algorithms they made by others. They can be us who use the algorithm.","•	We can come up with an algorithm to check if the proxy variables are racially biased and if it is, it would reject the data and request for a new set of data until the data is not bias. I think they did not consider that it might cause a racial bias. And they would want to gain the result that they hoped to get. Thus, when we decide to develop an algorithm, we have to think about the racial factors.",11,34,26,29,•	100 billion would not be enough since if we talk about the educational level and to provide everyone with the ability to attend college the amount of money needed could not be calculated so a majority of the money would already go on to that field and then plus the money require for the other category is already a lot so 100 billion would not be enough.
9/24/2021 18:10:23,B1-5,"Overtime in history there has been a long spanning issue of racism and for the longest time it was always just thought of as a way of life for example, Slavery has been around for a long time and it did not originally start with racism originally it would just be the social class that you were born into that you would stay in. However overtime as time progressed color of skin had more and more to do with your skin color. Once christianity made it Immoral to have slaves, people began coming up with all types of justification to the superiority of their color vs another and that being the reason why they should not be allowed to advance and must be a slave or servant. Today's society is much different over how to look at and address racism and while still embedded into society its a much more widely understood thing and much less widely accepted. A solution to helping everyone understanding history would be to spend 15 billion to 20 billion dollars on research for ",I dont think we can change racism on a society level,A solution to addressing racism on the human level  would be to educate. Many people have racial biases and opinions due to parents and gaps between society. So my solution would be to have classes to educate children and expose children to diverse people  and different cultures. This way they’re not only being taught social opinions from their parents and they would be exposed to other cultures as well.,"Addressing racism technologically would be challenging. Subconscious bias usually creeps in when developing technology that deals directly with humans. It could be the initial data fed to the machine, the bias that the developer had while coding etc. There would be several ways to prevent bias and racism through technology. We ",10,40,20,30,"No, 100 billion would not be enough because the money would have to be stretched over generations. There is no viable solution for racism that works in one year.

9/23/2021 11:57:23,B2-1,"We need to educate the youth more. Racism is reproduced because it is passed down onto newer generations. Therefore, the more time and resources we spend on educating the youth about the history and inequalities of structural racism, the less likely it is to be able to spread into the future. One problem that can be tackled is the lack of educational reach, for which a program providing free education can be made to counter.","We need to take racism more seriously and hold people more accountable who commit discriminatory actions. For instance, the law needs to punish authorities who seek out to arrest certain racial groups. This will set an example to others as to how we shouldn’t display racial bias. One issue could be the justice system (police or judges) decide not to enforce stricter rules; to which they could be made liable to lose their jobs.","For a simple solution, one way to change the fact that people who are making the underlying decisions are doing so in a racially biased way is to simply change the people who are making the decisions. For example we'll use Microsoft again, if an aspect of microsoft was behaving in a racially biased way; whoever made the portion that was acting in such a way could be fired and replaced; and whoever replaced the individual(s) fired would sort back through, fix the racist aspect(s) and continue improving upon them in future models. One issue with this is the act of actually firing someone. However I don’t think that would be a hard challenge to overcome; because in this case they would have made an impactful decision which could have/did harm people and no job done is better than their bad job done; if they couldn’t be easily replaced.","In order to address this issue, we need to monitor the development of AI systems. We should have organizations that have the responsibility of checking AI systems and making sure that the original developers make unbiased decisions that are inclusive of people of all backgrounds. Instead of using old data and analysing the places that crime had occurred into the algorithm, we can use AI for facial recognition to catch criminals. This can remove the bias of race and discriminiation against black people. It can also remove over-policing in the area. One issue with this could be the third-party failed to detect bias, or the data was unreliable. For that; further research/hiring could possibly fix the solution.",40,10,10,40,"Yes, 100 Billion USD is enough money to address the problem we seek to solve.

We need to promote diversity in the workplace and lobby against organizations that are being explicitly racist.,"To address the fact that racial biases and discrimination are built into our society at a structual level, we have to slowly unravel the racism in our community. By focusing more on our youth, communities and values such as improving the livelihoods of minority communities. We can do this by reducing the amount of arrests and improving the areas overall. When we focus on the youth, we can eliminate the roots of racism before these ideals get planted into the youth of America. If you start teaching about this stuff in the early learning stages, you can prevent this racial bias from reproducing and continuing in American society","In order to address the fact that the people who made the underlying decisions did so in a racially biased way, we should better train the police and increase the use of body cameras worn by the police. This will limit the racially biased decisions of the police officers because now there would be digital evidence if they ever do something in a racially biased way. With the evidence, they would be held accountable and would be fired.","Because modern day algorithms are based on old data from a time when racism wasn’t as talked about or as addressed as it is today, the only way to truly remove racist outputs from these programs and algorithms is to completely redo the data from the ground up.

9/23/2021 11:56:15,B2-3,"I would start my solution by bringing about an education system where an emphasis is put on teaching students about the beginnings of racism and the many negative consequences  that followed afterwards for people of color and minority groups. This would show kids at a young age the impacts of their words and actions, and slowly mold society into a less racist environment. This education can lead to other ideas like projects and social events where people create ways to root out racism.","In my opinion, it’s more of an civic problem than a technological problem. People have their own mindset and some promote racism. The solution that I have is changing what people think by convincing people through articles, news, speech, anything. By changing what people think, society will be friendlier toward other races. Algorithms will be changed to approve other races. And it can potentially establish laws that specifically reduce racism from state laws, technology, anything that promotes racism","I believe that we should first equally distribute school funding. I believe that schools should have their funds from the taxpayers, but certain schools should as well receive extra help in the form of sufficient and constant funds. This will help to raise kids that make better decisions, are more prepared to go into college, and succeed in life. If education quality rises there will be healthy competition allowing more bright minds to change the country for the better. After time those schools will raise generations of people that weren’t at such a disadvantage and will accumulate sufficient amounts of money to keep the education on a good level without any extra funding.","A solution with a technological analysis would be to have more issues shown across social media and news more often. For example, with the death of George Floyd, his death was shown across all of social media so everyone knew about the situation. But that does not happen to everyone that falls victim to racial bias. Almost everyone, especially kids of younger age, use social media. So if we show these issues on these social media platforms, the kids that are using them can see what actually happens and learn so they do not grow up with a racial bias. Potential challenges would be getting these social media companies to actually comply and spread the word of racial bias to their users. But I feel like it would happen like a domino effect, once one company starts doing it then more will join in.",10000000000,30000000000,35000000000,25000000000,"Yes, 100 billion may be enough for the next 5-7 years to come, but in the future, we will probably need more funds.

9/23/2021 12:00:46,B2-4,"People have already begun to recognize the fact that American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, however the steps to change have not TRULY been effective enough yet. It will take a long time for racist ideas to stop being passed through generations. However, with activism like the Black Lives Matter movement, people can begin to recognize their flaws and change for the better. Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. ","Many categories in our lives are organised based on racial identities. Changing this can be hard as it is entertained with many important aspects of your lives. We would have to start off with small changes. The first and most important category which racism should be abolished from is education. This is because children should not be disadvantaged because of their colour or where they were born. This can be done by providing everyone, regardless of colour, or race, with schools which have the same facilities and funding. This gives everyone a level ground from which they can build upon. It would mean that growing up in a rich neighbourhood doesn't give you a better school thereby reducing the disadvantage that Black Americans face when going to school. Challenges that may come alone is that some politicians in these more wealthier areas may be against this funding of education due to some racial bias, a way we can counteract this is by increased activism as mentioned above in order to push the idea that equality needs to be reached. ","The way that we may be able to address or change the fact that ""people who made the underlying decisions did so in a racially biased way"" is by educating people about various cultures and the effects of racism as well as promoting diversity and inclusiveness through the use of the education system. The use of the American education system can be used in various ways to address racially biased decisions as children can be educated about diversity and inclusion which helps deviate from more racially biased beliefs. This is one of many things that the education system can do in order to decrease racial bias and racism as a whole. From here, it is all about the implementation and creation of new programs, advertisements, and curriculum which can help us deviate away from a racist world. Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums. We can solve this by having a mandate which requires schools to implement a program which speaks on the topic of racism and provide funding for research to aid in the development of a curriculum.","People generally like to discredit this idea because they think that it's a very long process and will take a long time, the idea being to start from zero. I know that it's a very difficult process to do that, but there are hundreds and thousands of computer science majors doing a job which doesn't bring out their complete potential. So start by bringing them all together and start collecting the data from afresh too, meaning that the algorithm won't take the past data, but will comprise the data of the coming decade. To ensure that racial decisions are not made, an ""inside"" man will be there in courtrooms to give information when a racial decision is made. I know a decade sounds like a long time(and it is), but compared to the data in the algorithm being racists, it's better to wait a decade. Then create a just algorithm. The challenges faced in this would be to convince the companies to wipe out the old data and to overcome this, we need to convince them that their algorithm is racist and is an active problem that is affecting others. ",10,50,20,20,"100 Billion may not be enough to address the problem mentioned above. The solutions to these problems stretch deep into the roots of society and require more money in order to rip out these roots. This starts with education where a lot of this funding will go. In terms of funding for disadvantaged schools and money in order to create a new curriculum that addresses the effects and importance of equality and racism. Upward of $50 billion may help us gather more and better data to be used in our research for the issues mentioned above.

9/23/2021 12:01:55,B2-5,"We think that the way to solve issues of racism on a hisotrical level is to recognize that many institutions of power in this country are peerdominately run by white individuals and there has been little breaks in this pattern in history. While the past can’t be changed, we can influence there to be more diversity in forms of societal power in order to make sure that the variety of perspectives avoids repeating issues and targeting. ","We think that the best way to reform issues of racism on a societal amd structural level is to give more financial support for communities where minority groups of people of color are the primary residents of those communities. We believe that providing more money would help the disparity between these groups and white groups would be recognized as donnating more money into more diverse communities allow for more non-white people to have access to better education and resources, and would allow them to have the same accessibility of resources as white people on a societal level so that wealth is not a facotr that reinforces structural racism by not giving equal accessibility of resources.","As a group, we think that the best way to address the issues about how human decision making reflected racist decission making is to increase the factors in the data set by adding more groups to the data set. We think that adding more groups would add more diversity into the data set and this incorporates that data is not based around targeting only one combination of identifying factors to decide if a person is identified as a criminal. This change would allow for less bias information in future data sets that would prevent minority groups and People of Color from being primarily targeted by ideas that identify people based on a single common factor (such as skin tone).","The solution we have to address the technological instances of racism in our structures would be to create a third party group to review the information that is used in the data set and research how the data that the algorithms use is calculated. A primary issue with Predpol’s algorithm was that the proxy variable was just made as an assumption (the number of times a crime has previously been recorded in a specific community) without testing how accurate this variable would lead into accurately calculating the likelihood of crime from occuring based on this variable. We think a review group would help to review data and identify elements where bias is noted in a specific cases and remove cases from the dataset where bias is evident. While this may not remove bias entirely, it makes sure that proxy variables have more research put into them and helps reduce bias in data sets that target and discriminate against certain groups.",20,35,25,25,"We think that 100 billion would be a good amount of money in the start to address and try to change issues of racism in these categories as we would begin to take account for what is required there. However, we believe that in the long run we would need to spend more money in these categories because changing these categories to have solutions that are more inclusive to other groups would lead to more individuals using these more accessible resources. Hence, you have the issue of capitalism in the changes were you always need more money overtime to address the increasing needs of more people becoming involved in these programs. Ultimately, the solution of how much additional money is tricky because it is proportional to the percentage increase in each category. If a group is increasing by 25%, then  you want to add at least 25% of the original total funding added to the new group of the old amount of funding along with the additional expenses needed. We don’t have a specific group to allocate most of our additional funding in because they would all require more money gradually over time. However, if we had to choose, we would use most of our funding on the Structural/society group issues because funding there would be the most effective in addressing the other categories as a result of the structural solution thriving.

Problems created in the past that are still affecting people today should be solved in some way with these laws. Based on the actual effects of these laws, they can be amended further if they don’t work as intended. ",Another way to change the American structure/society & change people’s thoughts about society's is to enforce stricter/harder laws and apply consequences that occur between people of color and people of white backgrounds on a race crime committed it. These things should be taken more seriously to allow the government and law enforcement officials to show the community and society that they do not meet their standards on racial status.,Completely get rid of predpol and start the program completely over. Create a blank program without the previously bias proxy variable and instead use a community report system where everyone has the ability to report the area of a crime providing extremely accurate data and allow all crimes to be reported and used in the algorithm rather than the high concentration that were reported in minority areas due to over policing. ,Completely get rid of predpol and start the program completely over.

9/23/2021 10:14:04,B3-2,"Another way to address this is to, although it does not relate to the videos, remove public displays that commemorate or praise racist people or ideologies. This sounds like a lot, but it could be smaller than a mass crack down. This would be actions such as moving statues to old confederate leaders in the south from in the middle of a crossway to museums. The past should be remembered, but in many cases in the south and even in some places here in the north it is idolized in statues or other plaques or commemorations. I don't think we should get rid of them, but rather move them into museums or other like grounds where people can clearly connect them to the past instead of seeing them every day. This would help change the public opinion of some strong figures that are still depicted across america if they were properly represented as a part of the past in this manner and may over all lead to less racism, as some people even today hold many statues in high regard.","To change the fact that ""American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, and structural racism is reproduced over time,"" we must dive deeper into the root of the problem. Following the abolition of slavery, African Americans were met with harsh discrimination and faced new hurdles like  Jim Crow Laws and additional systems meant to oppress black communities. Even following the desegregation of public schools through the ruling of Brown v. Board in 1954, there have been large gaps between the academic success of African-Americans and white Americans. To alter this, America's public education system should be streamlined in order to level the playing field for all students. Schools should receive equal funding, have the same curriculum, and offer easily accessible resources to students. The academic success of students drives their futures. Enhancing the education received by black communities will promote better economic/socio economic standings for black americans.","In the legal system, reward people for making unbiased decisions when creating algorithms and penalize them for making racially biased decisions. This will encourage people in higher up positions to make less biased decisions that can lead to a more systemic change.", Another way we change and address this problem to prevent racial discrimination in algorithms to take extra caution when creating a proxy variable. The developing company should create a test which people need to take before being considered for creating a non-racist algorithm.

Realistically this would take national budget allocation due to the complex nature of this issue. "

Potential issues like incorrect data would be solved by switching out the people and getting more data.,Equal funding for all schools is one way to fix structural racism. Building more schools or donating more money to renovate schools. Potential issues would be solved by consulting local authorities.,Campaigns to give awareness and making sure minorities know their voices are being heard. The more awareness brought to this long lasting issue will promote more change. Setting up protests and using social media to spread the word about these types of protests. Potential issues would be people's contradicting views. To tackle that problem we would just keep going. ,"One way to fix racist technology is to make sure police are spread out. An app like Predpol but instead of tracking the location of crime, they should track the location of police to make sure there is a normal amount in one area at once. This would help stop over policing. Getting more police and collecting more data on the police.",20000000000,30000000000,10000000000,15000000000,"Yes, 100 billion dollars would be enough. The majority of the funding would go to the education system. Making more schools, rebuilding old buildings and giving a quality education would be the most expensive. We would have about 25 billion dollars left over, which we could spread across all the problems solutions. Education would get the most money because it is the largest scale. There are thousands of schools so this would be the hardest to do without a good budget."
9/23/2021 10:10:57,B3-4,"At a young age in our schools we should teach our kids more about minority history. Teach the kids to be better early on, teach them not to judge people on how they look but how they act as a person.","The best way we could tackle this problem is by putting a term limit on our congress, senators and representatives, and get younger people of all races and different demographics to represent our people. We need fresh ideas to circulate around the government instead of all the old ideas that have just been being reused.","Housing in America has been a major source of discrimination and racial profiling in the past. This could be reformed by having affordable housing everywhere. And not allow discriminatory HOA and other agencies to keep their neighborhood segregated. This would make communities more inclusive and have a variety of races, instead of having a majority. In addition to this, a regulatory board would be set up in each state, as well as nationally to enforce new rules and not allow discrimination. ","There are many problems with different proxy variables in today's society, one solution is that we augment education to spread light on the fact that racially biased proxy variables, whether intentional or not, may have a negative impact on our community as a whole.",20,20,20,40,"Yes, because if the money is properly allocated it will have a trickle down effect and be useful for all of the categories, in order to start to solve the problems mentioned. This money will be used to organize and effectively create change."
9/23/2021 10:25:06,B3-5,"People should be more aware of racism historically and the obstacles put onto people's paths. I would not just talk about black people's history with racism but also include other cultures because that's a biased way to discuss the history of racism. Almost all ethnic groups have dealt with racism, just some more than others, and being taught about racism with other ethnic groups helps get a more in- depth understanding of it.","Society will always separate people on a structural level based on their wealth, religion, education, race, etc. We can stop racial biases and discrimination on certain groups of people by seeing them as universally equal rather then separating them based the identity that makes them. When we separate people into groups, there will always be a dominant group and minority group and as a result there will always be some sort of racial or “identorial” discrimination.","Well everyone has their own type of bias regardless of whether or not they want to show it. There is always the possibility of a person's bias coming into play when making an algorithm. We can avoid this by having multiple groups of people from different backgrounds work on a single algorithm that way there wouldn't be any ""profiling"" or discrimination against a certain group.",Technology will always be a part of society and will always be targeted at certain people. If we remove this “target variable” then there is the potential of racial inequality decreasing at a technological level. An example of this would be algorithms and programs that are made to track certain groups or even just individuals.,25,25,25,25,"Yes, I think $100 billion is more then enough to solve our problem. My initial solution actually doesn't even require that much money. If we take the solution of teaching children at a young age in school, then we don't really need extra money. Teachers would already be on regular payroll and no extra money would be needed. But I were to do a combination of all the different solutions, then I think we would need a little more money. "
9/23/2021 14:56:26,B4-1,"History cannot be changed, only used as an example. An example of what not to do in the future. We must behave with precaution while learning about previous hate-filled actions in order to avoid following the same paths. Implementing anti-racial behavior through teaching will help others think anout how our actions will affect other groups of people before we. ","As a society, we can speak up louder and louder until our politicians and lawmakers change the fundamental laws to specifically punish discimination and racism. Sure the laws of our country aren’t racist or discriminatory anymore, but they also don't condemn those who are racist. These laws basically let racists be discriminatory as long as they don't break the specific law. We can fund groups that specifically want to address the problem of discrimination in our laws and have them hire lobbyists.","The human element of racism might be the most important place to try to create change in our society. No matter what we do in the society/structures, history, and technological elements of this problem, nothing will change if everyone isn't willing to change with it. To that end, a way we could solve the human problem of racism would be to change people's disillusions about race and inform them about human equality and how to respect other people.  The execution of this would be to go to sources of information that people rely on the most, this would be social media, influencers, advertisements, and people that many respect such as celebrities. Then we would need to weed out the ones who are racist using some sort of test and find the most neutral ones. Then we would have to spam advertisements posts and have people sponsor messages that relate to equality and human rights. We would take experts on the topic of inequality and put them on the forefront of the movement and force people to listen to them because time and time again we have been shown that people would rather ignore a problem than face it. By forcing people to face the issues in society they would need to admit that there are problems that exist and would eventually subconsciously or consciously make decisions that would help in the fight against racism.","We can combat technological racism through data filtration. Making an AI that will detect racial biases(as in if there's an unusal activity in the data if black or other colored people have been arrested or accused of crimes more in a area the AI will run its program to try figure out if it was actually a right claim). Ground investigations should back up algorithm based activity. There should be a willingness to acknowledge mistakes and take action in attempts to improve said technology. Finally, teach the people behind the program builds. Make them take courses about anti-racism. Get the help of historians and use a divers set of proxy variables. ",10,20,10,60,100 billion is definitely not enough money to address the problem. A measly 100 Billion is not going to solve hundreds of years of racism built into our society. Throwing money at a problem is such a U.S. way of doing things. We think the most effective way would be activism from people.
9/23/2021 14:53:20,B4-2,"There is no way to bring about meaningful change until it can be enacted by people who hold tangible power, rather than intangible power (as in cultural/social privilege). American politics is notorious for resisting change through the means of blocking legislature. We need to remember that these people are elected officials who represent the interest of their constituency. So, some change needs to occur that threatens the election of individuals who propagate racism in the legislature. This can be done by diversifying areas from where these individuals are elected from. Not only will it make for a fairer demographic, but integration of POC and people who make racially charged political decisions will also potentially foster inter-community bonds.","At a structural level racism exists due to the fact that back when cities were developing, people would not sell their property to African Americans or other minority groups. This resulted in structural racism, or geographically divided cities based on race. One way to end the racism built into American society could be by increasing opportunities to those inside of the redlined neighborhoods. This could be through something such as offering more aid for the schools to provide the students with a better quality education, creating more students in search of professional careers, which would result in a higher income that would allow them to leave or improve upon their neighborhoods. This would lessen and eventually eradicate the structural divide in the nation amongst whites and minorities, resulting in more diverse neighborhoods which would lead to less racist arrests due it being harder to target one specific neighborhood with a minority majority. ","We may address the problem by bringing it to attention and informing others on how the decision has impacted our society now, for example in marginalized societies. To be aware of the fact that there is a problem and what it is and where it comes from. Therefore, find the root of the problem and fix the problem from there. Although this will result in a full reconstruction of our society and how things are viewed inside it.","We would address/change the fact that ""the algorithm developers chose a proxy variable that had racial bias"" by actually adding more diversity to the AI field itself as underrepresented groups would be more attuned to tending to any existing bias in an algorithm. ​​The solution here is diversity - scholars who can look over and understand what the algorithm means for minorities must be integrated into the developing team, and thorough testing with every possible case of data must be done (re-evaluation).",10,64,10,16,"We think that 100 billion is not enough money to address the problem we seek to solve, because the more money that we have, the more effective we could be in our campaign to end racism. For example, 97.8 billion dollars goes to New York City each year, and we feel as if it should be more money due to the fact that we are tackling a nationwide problem, not just a problem in one city. 500 billion dollars would be much more effective in solving the problem of racism in America, as most of this money would be allocated towards the structural category, meaning the funding of schools and education inside of the segregated areas of the nation. We believe this would be the most important category to fund because it costs the most money to ensure that each child is granted an equal opportunity to get high paying jobs that would get them out of poverty, resulting in a breaking down of barriers between segregated cities in America.

Express these ideas or solutions to more people and make them learn things from it. ,"American society has always been divided primarily because of its history with people of color. A solution to this problem is for Americans to pay back reparations for all injustice done in the past. These reparations should be invested in public school funding and community centers that teach people to trade because this will encourage more young people to stay in school instead of dropping out, and it might mean that fewer teens turn to gang-related activity. Which lessens the amount of police roaming the neighborhood. And keeps the neighborhood from being a redlining zone. And over time minorities build wealth. ","To eliminate racial prejudice we have to call out all the racist jokes and statements that people make. By doing this, people will then realize that racial jokes are offensive to others, and would try to refrain from making them. We should have lessons talking about racism within our communities and workspace. Talking about uncomfortable topics and getting to the root of it. Giving ideas and suggestions to change how racial biases are in our workspace. Standing up for people who are being unjustly wronged.","Give the number of arrests in an area with the data of where the police were portoling when this is happening. That way the algorithm can recognize if an area had over-policing, which it would know results in more arrests [effect of over policing from CNBC report “How AI Could Reinforce Biases In The Criminal Justice System”]. It would also recognize if a location has zero or very few reports if it is because there are no potrols there. The algorithm would be able to balance it accordingly with over-policing and underpolicing being calculated.",20,50,20,10,"To fix this issue of racism the majority of the solutions come from reforming the educational system. To get a national change in education would mean a lot of restructuring which would cost a lot of money. For example a higher education level attained correlates positively with the financial stability a person has. Minorities tend to have lower attained education levels than their white counterparts. And so by getting better resources in school to learn and providing more opportunities for minorities to further their education and introduce them to higher-paying jobs and benefits which will allow them to build generational wealth. 100 billion is not enough money to address educational inequality because we would have to provide free equal education to all minorities nationally, which would cost a lot of money. As Well as restructuring how schools are teached to talk about racism more often and teach students how it can be addressed."
9/23/2021 15:03:07,B4-4,"If American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, then we should act to address the problem now, because the past cannot be changed but the present and the future can be determined through our actions that we make today. One thing that could be done is create new algorithms to replace the current ones that do not favor any race, and feed it data that has a lot of variety and no particular bias toward any race. One potential challenge could be that the data itself is limited to one specific race and unintentionally become racist, but that can be overcome by reducing that amount of data given to the algorithm by sorting out the irrelevant data within the biased data.","Racism nowadays can be subtle but impactful. We believe an algorithm should be built to analyze statistics concerning social structures and services to find patterns of racism. The agencies that are found racist can then be further investigated and fixed on a case by case basis. This algorithm would essentially take on investigating institutions that make the most impact on people’s lives (i.e. banks, medicine dispensaries, real estate) and look to see if anything is happening to people of a certain race proportionally more than other people. Inherent disadvantage would be investigated. The maintenance and investigation would be government run, and large institutions would be required to give it their data for analysis. One problem could be institutions doctoring their data. In this context, doctoring of data would be highly illegal. Institutions could have their vendoring rights at stake if they do not comply.","To change the fact that officers are over policing in black communities and leading to a racial bias when they are making arrests, we can push companies to create more efficient algorithms that can make decisions with the least amount of bias. We can also try to show officers the data of over policing in black communities and how this is leading to arrests that can be seen in a racially biased stand point. We could create this change by collecting new data by not over policing in areas and getting an accurate reading of where crime is and where we need police officers more, not just in primarily black communities. A potential challenge that we might face is allowing human bias to interfere with the new data being collected and allowing that to be put into the algorithm which can then cause over policing in areas that were caused by human bias in certain areas.","By configuring the proxy variable to target a much larger area with a variety of races so that the variable has no racial bias towards any group of minorities. I would do it by eliminating any racial biased examples the algorithm has and replace it with examples that are not specific to any race, and try to not specify any race to any crime so that the algorithm does not rely on race to determine suspects. We can face any potential challenges by monitoring the effects that the new proxy variable has on the algorithm to determine whether the change fixed the racial bias or not. This way we can configure the proxy variable again before it affects people.",15,35,20,30,"$100 Billion may be enough money to address the problems that we’re currently looking at, however if the problem takes more time and resources to solve then we can easily surpass that $100 Billion budget. Starting up new government agencies can be particularly expensive, and doing so might even end up taking up half of the budget. Some of the solutions described above are similar enough to be created simultaneously and under the same management, life for the Structural and Technological solutions."
9/23/2021 14:57:28,B4-5,"An influential and impactful way to address/change the fact that American society has always been historically unequal and discriminatory towards minorities, especially African Americans, is giving more opportunities to minorities. As seen in the ""IP student video,"" one of the students explained the impacts and gravity of ""Redlining"" which, ""... the effects of racist initiatives, such as redlining, and how it affected people to this day in regards to the funding in which their middle school or elementary school received, which oftentimes were zoned based on where they lived. Unfortunately, the quality of the education lacked in areas where people were poor, and oftentimes these areas were mostly populated with people of color or minority groups."" Unfortunately, fixing the grave mistakes and damage of redlining is no easy feat, in which solutions could take decades to be implemented, however, offering more opportunities such as jobs and better education to minorities that are still impacted by the effects of redlining can allow them to have a better chance of succeeding in the United States.","To take a simple example, there was a psychological experiment. They prepared 5,000 fake resumes, half with ""traditional white names"" and the other half with ""traditional black names"". Everything on the resume is the same except the name. It turned out that resumes with white names were 50 percent more likely to be invited for an interview than those with black names. That doesn't necessarily mean corporate HR managers are racist. It is likely that they do not consciously reject black names on their resumes, but because of subconscious bias. So my solution is that people need to think about whether a decision makes sense before they make it. You can't be racist because of some subconscious point of view. What the government needs to do is to ensure that everyone has equal access to police and education.","One way to address racism at a human level is by having diverse groups of people coming together and comfortably addressing each other's differences, along with finding a middle ground in commonalities they might share. At the end of the day, structural racism ends up in the hands of humans and their thinking, as enforcing a fair and equal structure is up to the people to follow. Having a society where everyone embraces each others' similarities and differences is a good starting point to prevent future racism. This solution of having people understand each other's differences and similarities will improve people's decision-making and help get people to educate themselves with unfamiliar topics about different races, instead of unintentionally expressing racist views. One way to go about this is by having fun and/or informational programs which combine different groups of people.  Producing popular books and websites to help educate different cultures and traditions of different groups is another way to go about this.","One way to fix this issue would be to alter the crime report data to remove the racial bias associated with it. If we could find an accurate correlation between the number of on-duty officers in an area and the rate at which crimes are reported by comparing different sets of crime report data, we can adjust the data to represent what it would look like if over-policed areas weren’t over-policed. A more accurate way of doing this would be to create unbiased data by putting the same number of officers in every community that they overlook for a certain period of time. We can then look at the crime report data knowing that racially influenced over-policing wasn’t a factor in the outcome, allowing it to be used for the algorithm.",30,50,15,45,"No, 100 billion is not enough to address the problem. All of our solutions involve lots of new jobs and infrastructure that need to be put in place to make the change. We would need more funding for  Historical, Structural, and Technological changes. The extra funding would go towards new buildings, advertising, payment for all people involved, payment for studies, establishing a revised educational system, and more. Overall, bringing change to American society would be rigorous and expensive, but ultimately worth it.

We should also look for a more equal justice system, and equality for all rather than the few.

Racism is absolute and it can not be terminated from society, it can only be improved and reduced by social events and allowing people to actually acknowledge the seriousness of the problem.","Racism at the technological level is some that can come  from the data that humans provide. The solution that can be used in a technological structure can be that the data that is provided for anything  or something important in general  has to be some that does not take in past data. Meaning that the technological side of how we address racism should be updated every year so like how much of the software that we use. When taking past data as an input to train AI, we should integrate algorithms that identify possible biases that exist in the data, eliminate biases, and monitor the training process, which should effectively prevent AI algorithms becoming racist.",20,40,10,30,"

This gives their children a better education and these schools will teach about the racist principles that have been a part of this country since its founding. One challenge that could arise could be that teaching about the racists ideas and principles in our country could lead to children identifying with those same principles. Another challenge is that there could be teachers who don’t want to teach about these topics. One way to solve these challenges is to have schools undergo yearly checks of their courses to ensure these classes are being taught the way they should be.,Making a new algorithm that searches for more unbiased officers and uses it in conjunction with another that based on a report checks if the person accused has actually broken the law.

10/8/2021 13:33:45,C1-5,"In the first Impossible Project, in one of the videos (PBS video), it walked us through really old times, showing how the race was being affected by different times/eras. One example would be in the enlightenment era, where White people created documents in order to see if Black People were physically ""white"". It was unequal and discriminatory by the simple fact that each body is built differently and not everyone has the same skeleton structure. For structural racism, it would be with one of the videos, the last one, Dr. Khalil, he told history on how Black people were being criminalized through history by telling parallel history. Another example of structural racism in modern times would be the assassination of George Floyd, who was killed by a cop, Mr. Floyd said multiple times that he couldn't breathe but the cop didn't care. All of these are connected because they are police brutality, I think the way to tackle this is to train cops in a way where they don’t pull up the gun without receiving information of the suspect they have. Maybe taking away guns and just giving them the tazers. More verbal warning rather than just taking out the gun while giving them a verbal warning this could heat up things more and the cop could shoot. ","To change the fact that ""racial biases and discrimination are built into our society at a structural level"", we would have to fix what redlining has done to the black community. Redlining was done in order to keep black people in the same neighborhood that has problems with poverty, gangs, and high crime rates. To attempt to fix this, the government can provide more funding to these areas instead of continuously providing the rich with more unnecessary funds. Giving more attention to schools in these neighborhoods could help benefit the future. A source of quality education is a great way to help out the community in the long run since it was already a step behind. To be specific, the government could try to build at least 1-2 new schools in these areas. More structures like apartments, restaurants, medical centers, can provide the basic needs of people and can also provide new job opportunities. We plan to put at least $30 billion into this category as it takes material and labor to build all of these buildings across all the states where these neighborhoods are. ","Focusing on police reform, this includes more training on de-escalation skills and anti-racist policies. Implement this training on de-escalation into police officers’ training in their academies, make the time spent training longer, and make requirements to join the police more strict. Also, coming up with more policies that would restrict the power given to police officers. There should be more organizations or groups that study this and try to get to the macro level of racism. These groups would focus on promoting anti-racism and educating people as well as getting to the core of the problem. Allocating $20 billion to every state will allow the police force to take a big step in the direction of an anti-racist system. ","Since we know that the proxy variable was past crime reports that were racially biased, a solution could be changing the definition of crime for these machine learning algorithms. For example, does an arrest count as a crime? Or should crime only count towards things like violence and burglary? I believe only serious arrests should count towards what “crime” is. This would change the proxy variable and effectively put the algorithm to its original use, thus not giving out racially biased predictions because the proxy variable was racially biased. Technology is not cheap, so $40 billion will be used in order to create new and non-biased algorithms. ",1000000000,3000000000,2000000000,4000000000,"We feel that 100 billion might not be enough to solve the problem. For example, the cost of building an elementary school is about 5.5 million. Let’s just say we build 200 new schools across all of these neighborhoods. After the construction is completed, we would need to hire teachers, staff members, etc. We expect at least 100 staff members in each school and we would hope these staffs are getting an average salary of 70k per year. When we add the math up, we feel that the structural category would use up most of the 100 billion. The Trillion mark would be a comfortable amount to solve these problems."

We would talk about how people were divided based on color and people didn’t have equal rights.. One way to do so would be to educate individuals in schools starting from a young age since they will be the future leaders and will be the ones influencing our society.","To address racism at the societal level, we would look at the policing systems and what allows the systems to work in a racist way, and rework them. We would do this by reforming  the policing system so they do not allow police officers to target minorities and minority communities, and better training police officers so they are more prepared for facing different situations. Some potential challenges that we would have to tackle would be educating the people and the officers and providing additional training to the police officers who have been working for multiple years.","In order to address the issue of racism on a person by person basis, where decisions relating to arrests contained varying levels of racist bias dependent on the individual in question. As discussed in the Prepol videos, many of the arrests in the data utilized to train the prediction model were either a direct result of racial bias, or influenced by it. With a decrease in human bias in arrests, the data used to train a program such as Prepol is less likely to determine that said racist behavior is an expected norm. ","To address this problem at a technological level, we should test the proxy variable to the max. In the video, the police officers were sent to locations who had prior high crime rates. In some ways, this is not fair because over time, crime rates in neighborhoods change. If there are more cops focused on a certain area, there would most likely be more arrests in that area. The less eyes patrolling a neighborhood, the less crime that will be noticed. Some challenges we might have to tackle is hiring more police officers so that every neighborhood has the same number of eyes patrolling it. By doing this, we will have much more accurate numbers regarding crime. ",38,25,12,25,"We think that 100 billion dollars is enough to address the problem that we seek to solve. We believe that if we distribute the money properly, it can be used for a long time to start up on our mission to address racism. 
"
10/8/2021 12:13:26,C2-2,"The American people must be better educated on the continuous repetition of racism in the United States. One method to tackling this could be through the education system. History curriculums can be reshaped in order to better address the history of racism in America and its effects. Although this won’t have immediate effects, over time the people entering society will be better educated and thus racism will be sure to decline. ","To address racism on a societal/structural level, we can start by encouraging or even making it mandatory that policies are enforced in companies and cooperates to have not only the board executive, but also employers and employees to engage in the history of racial bias and discrimination in the American Society as well as discussions about such matter, in doing so, this will foster a new of thinking on how to address racial bias and discrimination on a structural level. ",In order to address the racism occurring in America it’s important to acknowledge any racial biases or tendencies you may have yourself. Becoming aware of your racial biases can help one learn how to consciously avoid projecting those ideas onto others. ,The algorithms for AI machine learning must be changed with new datasets/information to reduce bias. A method of incorporating new datasets is including all races and cultures into sorting algorithms and algorithms used within our social media platforms and search engines.,10,50,10,30,"100 billion is a good starting point but over time further funding will be needed. In order to truly make a change in all these aspects of society more funding will surely be required. More funding would likely be needed in the history category as revamping curriculums on a nationwide level will be very pricey. Furthermore, in order to sustain the changes made on a structural level, continuous funding will be needed rather than a one time payment. 
"
10/8/2021 12:16:30,C2-3,"It’s important that we teach history from an objective, fair viewpoint. We must address the historical context that has produced our modern-day inequality including slavery, segeration and Jim Crowe Laws. We can incorporate this into our public school curriculum. Potential challenges would be getting teachers on board and involved in this curriculum but to overcome this problem, we should encourage teachers to help shape this curriculum. ",We must unravel what has been built into society at a structural level.  We must acknowledge and reform the flaws in our system that continue to disadvantage minority and low-income populations (i.e the jury and public defense system). There have been acts to prohibit certain issues such as red lining and the Community Reinvestment Act. With redlining we need to give everyone the same opportunity and let things fall into place there rather than automatically cutting off opportunities to certain people making it impossible for them to be educated and grow in life. To get rid of this racism at a structural level we need to stop addressing people as different based on their skin color (and area of wealth?)," Humans must change their way of thinking in order to get rid of this racism. Schools should teach the kids that there is no difference between a white person and a colored person. Everyone is equal, no one should get judged. To get rid of this idea of racism and that people are different, we need to stop addressing people as such. Address them as a person, nothing else. The new generations are the ones who can make a change as they are going to look after everything in future. People from the old generation and present can’t really change as they were raised with the mentality of racism. ","Although algorithms are machines that are told what to do, the proxy variables used with these algorithms cause racist outputs. By diversifying the proxy variables used in these algorithms, technology could become less racist. Data collectors should be encouraged to use datas from different communities which could create diversity as well as consider the potential bias associated with the data they use.",10000000000,55000000000,15000000000,20000000000,"While $100 Billion is certainly a lot of money, it is not enough to address and improve the extensive structural flaws in our country. Public defense, daycare, education, transportation, housing, and more, are all areas that contribute to inequality. The United States is a large country with over 300 million people. Healthcare alone in this country would take several hundred billion dollars to improve. To fix all of the structural flaws in our system, might take in between 1.5-3.5 trillion dollars."
10/8/2021 12:12:53,C2-4,"Since racial biases and discrimination are built into society at a structural level, one way to address the problem would be to teach students in schools about racial biases and discrimination throughout history to educate them in an effort to eliminate this in our society. You could do this by adding the topic as a requirement for school curriculums."," One way to address or change how there is racism in a structural level is to give or provide more resources to disadvantageous people and communities that have been historically hindered due to discrimination or racism. This would strive to increase equity to make it a more equal playing field because there are many groups that have advantages and that have disadvantages, if we were to give these groups the same treatment, the original group with historical advantages would have a higher hand or would have a higher chance of being successful. Some resources would be stimulus checks, scholarships, welfare checks, financial benefits, food, and more. These can help in our society where those who are most privileged and successful usually have a history of generational wealth. It may get hard to get funding. ","Another way to solve people making racially biased decisions is by establishing laws that fines people who make racially biased decisions. Just like in the Vox video Are We Automating Racism? Twitter has been using an automatic cropping algorithm that is biased towards white people over black. Since the developer of this system did not perform enough testing before releasing their program. People should be able to sue them or they would be fined for their programs. A potential challenge that may occur is an opposing group of people against the newly established law. However, in a democratic society, we just have to get the majority to support this law.","The problem is that algorithm developers that choose proxy variables that have racial bias can be solved by having representatives in their groups or companies that point out anything that can be racist. Like in the Vox video named Are We Automating Racism?, the Twitter automatic cropping algorithm created a program that favored white people over black people. Thus, to address this issue if the developer behind the program had an official that deals with racial biases these algorithms wouldn't have this kind of problem. I doubt a potential challenge would occur since a representative is selected and approved by others.",50000000000,20000000000,10000000000,20000000000,"$100 billion will not be enough. You can't pay people to change their minds. However, what we need is more time to teach the next generations about racism and how to think equally and fairly. So, putting the extra funding into the historical category solution would be best because we can teach the future generation about racism and shift their mindset on it, while increasing equity in education."
10/8/2021 12:19:58,C2-5,"Throughout history, black people have been criminalized and treated as second class citizens. This bias is passed down and changed from generation to generation. In order to break the cycle of racism, we have to educate children before the biases that are passed to them become their beliefs. ","One solution is to encourage people to vote for elected leaders that are committed to change. This is especially true for local governments that are more likely to listen to the wishes of the people. Even though people tend to be skeptical of politics these days, the quickest way to create change is through government policy and action. One example of how this can be done is through undoing past policies that were harmful to people of color. The video, Does My Neighborhood Determine My Future?, discusses how policies like redlining created areas of disinvestment and poverty. These areas were unfortunately inhabited mostly by minorities. Actions that could undo the damage caused by redlining would include providing more funding for schools in those areas, as well as funding for infrastructure and amenities. ","One solution would be to include more minorities in these decisions. For example, if the people who created PredPol received input from people who lived in the overpoliced neighborhoods, who tend to be mostly minorities, they would have been more likely to consider the presence of discrimination in the data that they use to develop the algorithm. Getting feedback from all the people that technologies impact is crucial because there tends to be a disconnect between them and those that create the technology, especially in the case of PredPol. In this case, the idea of predicting crime based on past data may have seemed like a good thing in the eyes of the police officers, but it may have seemed like bad news in the eyes of the people in the targeted communities. ","One solution would be to create a law or regulation which requires that data used for technology is evaluated for biases. These biases can include criteria such as gender, financial status, or age, in addition to race. If laws exist that prevent people and organizations from discrimination due to race in areas such as job interviewing and loan eligibility, there can be laws that prevent discrimination that is perpetuated by technology. ",15000000000,5000000000,20000000000,15000000000,"100 billion is enough to implement a temporary solution. However, in order to make sure that racism is ended and never returns, this is how educational systems need to be forever. This would require funds for years and years to come. 
We would put more money into the structural category. Even though history is the root of the entire problem, we cannot change history. What we can change is the structures that are present today. "
10/7/2021 15:01:01,C3-1,"One way might be to sort of hit the reset button; meaning that somehow, someway the playing field for minorities and the majority is leveled. For example, it might be possible that attributing funding to poor minority neighborhoods in areas of education, infrastructure, and making jobs to match white neighborhoods until the changes become stable.","In the Vox video titled Vox Video titled Does My Neighborhood Determine My Future?  they mention ""The first policy was called the homeowners loan corporation or HOLC or ""hulk"" part of HOLC was sending real estate appraisers to hundreds of cities across the country and these appraisers would grade neighbors in these cities, and this is where the term redlining comes from."" They define redlining as ""the practice of banks withholding home loan funds or Insurance from neighborhoods considered poor economic risks"", and this is a very key way that racial biases and discrimination were being built into our society at a structural level because the video showed us that these real estate appraisers had clear signs of bias in their evaluations of these neighborhoods. One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved.","You address the issue of structural racism being reproduced over time by giving more education on the subject. Racism is not something you are born with, it is something you are taught so if you have more education on it you are more likely to not be part of the discriminatory group. A solution to this could be to teach the developer to be anti-racist and choose new, not racially biased variables. Documents or programs could be made to guid and remind developers on how to keep their code unbiased.   Another way we can address this issue is to increase the budget of our police will cause our policing forces to be better equipped by re-training our current officers and establishing new training protocols to ensure that all of our new officers from there on can satisfactorily complete their jobs, and in the event of arrests and legal decisions, use no racial bias. This will also lead to a more accurate representation of our crime data through removal of racially biased decisions in our justice system, effectively making it easier to pinpoint where actual crime lies rather than accused crime through racial profiling.",A method that might work is changing the PredPol algorithm to account for racially biased data and then account for it when it tries to predict where the most crime occurs.  This might require a large team of people working many years to come up with an algorithm based on intense research and data collection. Then it would have to be implemented which could require expensive equipment in order to actually use and apply the new algorithm.,64000000000,15000000000,11000000000,10000000000,"It might not be enough for fixing the historical issues by using the reset button solution of allocating massive amounts of funding to help minority neighborhoods catch up. But, for the others it should be more than enough as the other most expensive solution would be the retraining/reeducation in the human solution and the other two are of a similar scope, while the history solution could take many more billions of dollars to level the playing field, so it would take the rest of the extra funding. 
"
10/7/2021 14:54:08,C3-2,We need to preserve and educate people about our nation’s history even the dark moments like legal discrimination and slavery. We should be aware of the effects and try to solve them instead of brushing them under the rug like the Tulsa Race Massacre. We need to tell people how the voter suppression laws in states like Texas and Georgia are similar to the ones of the Jim Crow era i.e. before 1960s. Critical Race Theory is the general study of the societal effects from the discrimination of black people in America. We shouldn’t ban Critical Race Theory like how states in the Deep South have done but instead push people into this field of study. ,"A prominent form of racism at a structural level is the lack of funding for schools in low-income communities. Black students disproportionately attend these schools and the quality of education at them is not on par with those in richer, more disproportionately white neighborhoods. Because property taxes are low, and that is what is used to fund education, the schools can’t afford to have a strong curriculum that prepares students for life.  To address this, more funding should be distributed to these communities so that the quality of education can be improved, and lead students down a road of success.","We humans should unite all together and say “NO” to racism. If we all make it clear that we are tired of the tension that exists between races, it is no longer going to exist. We can do that by starting a movement to raise people’s awareness about that. Peaceful protests are a good solution to make people's voices heard. Unity is the secret to achieve that goal. ","Personally, I would take some of the best programmers from all over the world to spend time working on an algorithm that could ignore factors like race, sex, and other factors that shouldn’t matter. Making algorithms have a non-bias, it will take people from many diverse backgrounds in coding and life to help put something together that you could add to any other algorithm that would take those factors and hopefully eliminate the program’s bias. It would almost be like how scientists from around the world came together to make the covid vaccine. If you had a one shoe fit all fix to racism for all algorithms, you can focus on other things like making sure the data you submit doesn’t hold a racial bias.",10,55,15,20,"While 100 billion gets the ball rolling, having more funding for structural and Technological would be helpful. Racism is so deeply rooted in so many areas of society, the budget to completely overturn it will be more than 100 billion alone.

Then we could analyse what were the flaws and find solutions that will make the society a better place for everyone. We would need the help of historians that will give a racial aspect of the society in a particular period. Another group of researchers could interpret those ideas. Focus on the most important points about racism and use the data not in a biased way.  Some potential challenges  are the accuracy of that information because some places don't have records that could be useful., We can prevent racism from society by making people understand that the United States is a country of various races and religions and everyone is working or trying to put effort to make America great again. We should always value one another and will try not to judge by their skin color because they are all part of the country and a part of us.,"We can prevent racism by changing people’s mindset. By creating awareness about their community, we can set up an organisation which will teach the general people the way of ife and the positive aspects of the country. By creating a mindset we can prosper in life positively and hopefully reduce racism.","It is the most “superficial” level, in the sense that solving the problem with the algorithm will not have any significant and lasting impact on the issue of racial bias in society as a whole, so it will receive the least amount of funding out of all four categories.  A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the “bias-removal” algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data. One might argue that this just shifts the problem from one algorithm to another, but in this case,  it might be effective to fight fire with fire. ",13000000000,40000000000,20000000000,17000000000,"The history budget will provide all the information in a large period of time and gathering the data would be cheaper than any other parts.

The structural budget could use the most money because organizing every specific part would be a challenge that requires a lot of resources.

The human budget will use a significant amount of money because the population is extremely important and could be the success or the failure of this project. 

The technological budget would be the lowest out of them all. According to https://medium.com/cognifeed/the-cost-of-machine-learning-projects-7ca3aea03a5c ,
It costs around $136,750 on the higher end to create a machine learning project. The annual compensation for a machine learning engineer is more than $170,949 according to https://builtin.com/salaries/dev-engineer/machine-learning-engineer. If we hire around 100000 engineers for this purpose, the total cost will be 17 Billion.

100 billion would not come even remotely close to solving the problem. We will need 1 trillion USD and more to be successful. A large amount of money needs to be funneled into making structural change. Usually, economic policies cost in the order of hundreds of billions, and trillions of dollars. If we need to make changes to structures that are well-entrenched in society, we will need an amount that is at least in that scale. "
10/7/2021 15:03:33,C3-5,"History What to do:  If the American society is structurally discriminatory, then the policies which are being followed or the culture that is still following should be banned.

What challenges we will have to face: There will be people who will oppose this as they are following their traditions from a long time. How we can overcome the challenges: We can set up organizations and campaigns that will patrol around the cities spreading awareness and knowledge about anti-racism and new point of views.","Society/Structure What to do: I would assign researchers to pay attention to the role of race and racism in our public and private institutions and offer evidence-based solutions for how to address these inequities. Those researchers will play a crucial role as we continue to elevate the public discourse around race and racism in America. What challenges we will face: Researchers can have their own racist intentions. How we can Overcome that: We can make the researchers are a diverse group of workers to make sure there is as much inclusivity as possible, to catch any unconscious racial notions. ","Human There are certain groups or areas where they use an algorithmic method for making decisions but at last the person in charge of the organisation makes the decision. If that underlying decision is not appropriate then they can establish a three-tier system where the decision will be revised by three different people, so that the decision will be accurate and others will not think it as racially biased.  Sometimes people intentionally take underlying decisions to fulfill their own needs and greed. Other thing that can be done to resolve this is to eliminate the power of making final decision by a person in a program where discrimination is more likely to occur. Rather give those powers of making underlying decisions to a group of people or AI or any other technologies.Challenges: The group may have motives of their own that are fueled by their own greed, which might lead to conflict, or if the group were to collude for their own gains, it might lead to decisions being taken that might benefit them only  Solution: One way to fix this would be to let the decisions that the group stand for vote amongst the members affected by them, this would be the best way to eliminate biases. ","I would start a research that presents a framework for algorithmic hygiene, which identifies some specific causes of biases and employs best practices to identify and mitigate them. Researchers also present a set of public policy recommendations, which promote the fair and ethical deployment of AI and machine learning technologies.

The cycle must be broken, and to achieve this we must start at the very bottom and work our way up. This change will take a lot of time, but is the only foreseeable way to ensure the cycle is completely broken. We can start at the education level by ensuring education centers in poor minority areas are modernized and teach a well-rounded curriculum that inspires young students to grow into the person they wish to be. To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole. This incentive aid will break the generational cycle of families who rely on federal aid.

Helping subsidize the cost of attending college would be a major step in the right direction. ,"Another way to change the fact that racial biases and discrimination are built into our society at a structural level would be by building up the minority communities neighborhoods.

American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, and structural racism is reproduced over time. It should not be unknown to us how people other than white complexion have been and are still being treated. We have failed as a society. Racism still exists between us and somehow reproduces over time. People believing in race superiority has been promoting their agenda. Historically America has always prefered white people over any other skin color and always violated black or brown people rights. American cops have been unrightfully arrested and accused black people with charges for the crimes they haven't even done. They created an image of black people as a negative member of their society and have always violated and discriminated against them. Now when AI technology like PredPol uses previous crime data, which was completely against black people. It targets more black people and thus in a way creating more racism.","Racial biases have built into society creating hurdles in education, politics and social structures.

For politics I would change policies that are backed by racist beliefs.","  I believe that when referring to the police arresting individuals in areas that they were looking for crime it makes sense. This is because they believe they will find more crime although that is a biased thought and it is partially due to our society embedding the idea that more crime occurs in areas that are majority black..One way that I would address to fix this issue would be to have an equal amount of cops patrolling in each area that their station is responsible for. If a certain area does legitimately report more crimes under those circumstances, then perhaps that data would be less biased", You could change the fact that an algorithm's developer chose proxy variables that had racial bias by having that data changed or removed for having racial bias. If this bias is removed then it is far less likely for algorithms to act in a racially biased way as it is trained in a more fair way. This problem could also be addressed by trying to use another algorithm to detect if racial bias played a significant role in the decision. If the decision was likely made in large part due to racial bias then that is when a person can review it and make the correct decision. ,10,35,35,20,"
Due to the large amount of resources that is needed to solve this problem, our group believes that 100 Billion USD is not a sufficient amount. One reason we believe this is due to the fact that the operating cost for policing nationally alone is 115 Billion USD. 500 Billion would be an appropriate amount perhaps even more funding may be needed in the future. We would allocate the majority of the funding into Structural because we believe that starting from the bottom is the solution. This means changing the way education is approached, politics, and jobs.

The set could possibly come from equally distributing policing by pure population and monitoring arrests, taking care to follow strict rules to avoid racist bias.

This is so people who rent can instead become homeowners and thus have a more active involvement in the economy of the country. By incentivising diverse communities to be built, a more diverse group would have access to utilities in areas that are already developed, while affordable housing would promote the better access of utilities like libraries and parks in low income areas.","We can raise public awareness of racial bias by spreading it on the news and social media that the people who made these underlying decisions did so in a racially biased way, as kind of like a shame method.

10/22/2021 15:44:17,D4-1," To combat the issue of structural racism in policing and in America as a whole, would be to hold the police and various other organizations that may unequally treat Black Americans (Insurance market possibly) more accountable for their actions. For policing specifically, there needs to be the abolishment of severe revamps in the idea of qualified immunity - the ability for police officers to act unlawful in an event that is ""out-of-line"". While it is valuable if the police officer was threatened by a gun, most Black Americans are subjected to aggressive force used by the police such as in the case of George Floyd. Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.  To combat the historical aspect of racism, there should be some form of racial bias education sessions mandated by all elementary schools and taught throughout the K-12 system. In hopes to maintain a community that does not actively have racial bias in the workforce, the training sessions should also exist in the workforce.","We can address the fact that racial biases and discrimination are structurally built into our society by acknowleding where certain races are disadvantaged and where we can improve as a country. For example, we can work to improve the POC experience when it comes to healthcare and make sure that they receive the same resources that white patients have. As aforementioned, we can fund the improvement and development of POC-majority institutions that are neglected or are disadvantaged due to this fact, such as schooling.","We would address this by suggesting that the people who submit information being used for the algorithms include a wider range of different neighborhoods, instead of mostly black dominant neighborhoods. We would also address this by making sure the police officers who are giving information for the algorithms don't have any racial biases, by also doing background checks on social media accounts and if they have been punished for excessive use of force against people of color. Another policy to add would be a statistic only policy for the data being submitted, and the data would be required to pass a verified statistic only test.","This has some sense to it from the outside peoples views but at the same time no sense at all.

Data can be altered.They could try to go back and make a much more advanced and specific algorithm starting from scratch with ""unbiased"" workers.

10/22/2021 15:45:20,D4-4,"The change in structural racism that can be reproduced overtime can be a change in government/state policies. The policies that affect minority groups and groups of color should be either restructured or eliminated. One of many policies that hurt the African American community was in 1933, when the federal government established the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to expand homeownership as a part of recovery from the Great Depression. The Corporation split up the races and left the black homeowners in vulnerable terms. With multiple court hearings, policy analysis, and multiple policy changes. Each policy could possibly cost a few billion dollars. We could reshuffle assets around and how things are run. So given this an estimate could definitely be up to 40 billion dollars. ","Opportunity, freedom, and prosperity does not have an equal affect towards everyone. Many families are facing severe economic problems because of structural barriers preventing them from thriving in a strong economy. Structural barriers are reasons for poverty and that needs to change. Best way to change this is to address the unfairness that the safety net programs are providing. Policymakers can also take action and evaluate proposals. Safety net programs can cost upwards to billions. With safety net programs being restructured it can cost anywhere up to 10 billion to 30 billion dollars. With millions of families out there each million can value 1000 families to provide. ","Decisions are made and accepted by people of different races before they can be made. Policies are made all the time. If you want proper checks going through these decisions that will be made through a board. To make sure these decisions don’t have any racial bias. If they do, the board will give them a fine or move them off their position. With having a board of checks it may cost up to 30 billion all the analytics, researchers, and resources to make the big decisions of not making the final decision racially biased. ",Proxy variables in algorithms can cause bias in a program. A solution to fix this is to have diversity in employees in creating programs. Having a board that analyzes data sets and proxy variables. Having multiple algorithms analyzing different data sets that come with different results that create the final result. This could possibly cost up to 30 billion dollars. Collecting all the data and putting it into algorithms can be costly. Technology itself is definitely costly. ,40,30,30,30,"A 100 billion dollars is definitely not enough because each solution is costly and time consuming if you want to get it right.

Back then it was literal segregation in schools and black students getting harassed just for attending schools, now we don't have that but instead, neighborhoods and schools with predominantly white people get a better education and more money while areas with minorities and/or people of color do not receive better education and money. A solution could be a requirement where states look at areas/neighborhoods where redlining occurs the most and start after school programs or programs that help minorities and people of color receive better education, and better opportunities in their communities and schools.   Provide courses for students Additional resources/ tutoring Transportation Teachers","Employers should not be choosing who they hire based on the color of employees skin, it should be based on if they meet the qualifications for the job they are seeking. Having more police in just one area is not fair, of course there will be more crime getting caught because there is more police, if there is police added to one place it should be added everywhere. Police should get more training on what to do in certain situations, and how to handle it.","Human  (Questions 5 and 6 on your Homework) It can be argued that not everyone who made the underlying decisions was meaning to be racial biased, so we could address it in a way where those who are responsible in making these underlying decisions need to be more responsible in checking for racial bias and to have more focus on this problem. Knowing that this occurs, those responsible should have a diverse group of people check their work so they can get more opinions and viewpoints and catch the racial bias before it is public and affecting our society negatively.  If the people who made the underlying decisions are intentionally racially biased then there should be a repercussion and they should no longer be responsible for making these underlying decisions. To make change we also need to focus on where the people making these decisions get their information from because there is racial bias already built into our society so the racial bias may not come from them, but to change this we must try to eliminate racial bias from the information we receive. Doing that would be very difficult and take lots of time so we should also educate and train people making these underlying decisions to be able to detect racial bias to avoid them from using it in their works, like an algorithm.","7)In order to avoid proxy variables with racial bias, have a team look through various variables and only allow ones without any biases. Without racial biased the algorithm would be fair and equal and not just based on racism from the creators. 8) Have a system already in the algorithm to take out and filter racial bias. So then the algorithm will be based on facts and statistics and not just the creators racist intentions. ",40,20,30,10,"No 100 billion isn’t enough money to address the problem. To be successful we would need 200 billion more, totally 300 billion. We would allow the majority of the extra funding to go to the structural category because we want to eliminate racism and all the problems that come from it in the most effective/ successful way, we would prefer to start from scratch and rebuild and reshape programs, institutions, education, etc. To eliminate racial bias and racial problems most effective way.

10/22/2021 15:49:16,D4-2,In order to change the fact that America has been historically unequal would be to have the government further provide funding to less privileged schools. That way students would have better understandings of discrimination against other races. ,,"We should give the people more power, while also removing the people who are currently in power. We should give the power to reject certain government decisions. If we remove the people who make the racially biased decisions, and replace them with a diverse group of individuals, we will create a diverse group of people who are in power.","We should remove the algorithm instead of relying on it to assume the strength of a police force before action is even taken. Maybe you should send a standard amount of forces to each area, and if the need for more forces arises, then you adjust the police force in that area accordingly.",45,20,15,20,"I think it would be enough. Our solutions would not cost too much, assuming that the fourth solution would only involve allocating resources. The first category would most likely be given most of the budget due to the work that is needed."
10/22/2021 16:24:03,D4-4,"The change in structural racism that can be reproduced overtime can be a change in government/state policies. The policies that affect minority groups and groups of color should be either restructured or eliminated. One of many policies that hurt the African American community was in 1933, when the federal government established the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to expand homeownership as a part of recovery from the Great Depression. The Corporation split up the races and left the black homeowners in vulnerable terms. With multiple court hearings, policy analysis, and multiple policy changes. Each policy could possibly cost a few billion dollars. We could reshuffle assets around and how things are run. So given this an estimate could definitely be up to 40 billion dollars. ","Opportunity, freedom, and prosperity does not have an equal affect towards everyone. Many families are facing severe economic problems because of structural barriers preventing them from thriving in a strong economy. Structural barriers are reasons for poverty and that needs to change. Best way to change this is to address the unfairness that the safety net programs are providing. Policymakers can also take action and evaluate proposals. Safety net programs can cost upwards to billions. With safety net programs being restructured it can cost anywhere up to 10 billion to 30 billion dollars. With millions of families out there each million can value 1000 families to provide. ","Decisions are made and accepted by people of different races before they can be made. Policies are made all the time. If you want proper checks going through these decisions that will be made through a board. To make sure these decisions don’t have any racial bias. If they do, the board will give them a fine or move them off their position. With having a board of checks it may cost up to 30 billion all the analytics, researchers, and resources to make the big decisions of not making the final decision racially biased. ",Proxy variables in algorithms can cause bias in a program. A solution to fix this is to have diversity in employees in creating programs. Having a board that analyzes data sets and proxy variables. Having multiple algorithms analyzing different data sets that come with different results that create the final result. This could possibly cost up to 30 billion dollars. Collecting all the data and putting it into algorithms can be costly. Technology itself is definitely costly. ,4000000000,1500000000,3000000000,3000000000,"A 100 billion dollars is definitely not enough because each solution is costly and time consuming if you want to get it right. Accumulating technology, policies, boards, and employees will definitely be costly. We need extra money to cover our solution for years to solve the solution.

As a part of a generation of future parents, it is going to be our job to inform our children about accepting people for having differences. Not only will we be responsible, as there will also be a national education reform that would allow students to learn history from different perspectives, and would also teach students about historical significance.",A possible solution would be to create a new department of the Judiciary Branch that would be able to review laws and cases specifically for racism occurring in them so that hopefully racism will no longer be involved in the government.,"A possible solution would be to hold all people accountable for the decisions they made with racial bias. To avoid this, people should expand their social and cultural environment and we should change the societal norms. There will be institutions that will provide people with the information needed to make this change.","The algorithm may have been effective, but the data that was being input could have been racist. If the government spent more money to get accurate data, then the algorithm may have worked as expected.",20,40,20,10,"100 billion is enough money to address the problem with the way we are looking to solve it. $100 billion is a lot of money that can be used to do a lot of good. If the entire city of New York, one of the biggest cities in the USA, had a $100 billion budget then we could probably do a lot of good with that same amount of money. The only category that we might want to allocate more money towards would probably be structural because we would have to hire new employees and actually set it up and make sure it works. Everything else can be done without needing more money."
10/22/2021 16:53:36,D1-1,You can’t change the past. Addressing this in our school system will have a major impact for future generations. Adding an incentive for people to take a class in high school  and reward the student with more financial aid will impact future generations' views on racism. A class like a racial study or history mainly focusing on how the American society has historically been unequal and discriminator and how structural racism is reproduced over time would greatly educate the students that will lead the future.,"The police choose to target certain areas where there are more minorities to stop crime and when the crime rate in those areas lower down they decide to stay there instead of moving on to another area where the crime level is actually a risk. Instead they shouldn't be bias and stay in one area and focus on one specific group, instead they shouldn't target people of color. Additionally by reducing the exposure and highlighting of negative impacts and bad news of non-white especially blacks, and they should be highlighting the goods of non white in our media which helps the reducing of racial biases in our society and in its’s structural level.","Having a bias doesn’t make  a person bad, however, and not every bias is negative or hurtful. It’s not recognizing biases that can lead to bad decisions at work, in life, and in relationships. For instance if a crime were to take place, and a person of color were to walk by, they would immediately be stopped based on how they look and how they may carry themselves. Another way to address this is creating tests with people of  all different cultures to test out software and big companies that we rely on heavily in our lives.",When making the algorithms have it mandated that you have to have X amount of people of color working on it to eliminate as much bias as possible. As well as when you train the algorithm make sure if you have X amount of photos of white people you have the same amount of minority photos.,40,25,25,30,"100 billion is not enough money to solve racism through our solution. We believe that increasing the amount of money allocated in our Historical would greatly impact and start a heavy impetus for structural, societal, technological change in the racial problems. Our solution that involves Historical includes the educational systems, and if  we want a great change we need a great amount of money to have a great impact on the education of students.

10/22/2021 16:54:47,D1-5,"The biggest way to break away from history and racist ideology taught to society is the past, is to teach the young people of today a revised version of history that acknowledges the intentional origins of racism and different perspectives (new textbooks/curriculum etc.). One problem with this is if people aren’t able to afford education. It is ideal if universal education in America included higher levels of education or if the cost of university was lower. America has much higher tuition compared to the rest of the world.","In today’s society, racism exists, throughout history racism has definitely evolved. However, in order to erase it completely from society, a change in its structure is necessary. The consequences for racist behaviors should be stricter and have a significant weight in society.  Many old fashioned structures still exist today which need to be gone as a result of evolution in everything. As time passes overtime, if you don’t keep up with it, then it can create unbalanced and produce unusual results and byproducts, which in this case is racism.","One way to change the fact that ""people who made the underlying decisions did so in a racially biased way”, is to expose people to more diverse situations on things like social media and in schools. We could teach children to be more accepting and understanding to people of a different race to eliminate the racism built up by their parents and their upbringing. We could also monitor the amount of hate speech on social media. There should also be more representation of minorities on major media platforms so people are exposed to diversity.",To change racism and bias at a technological level you need to have a good data set. “make sure that people do not overlook anything in the data set. They have to be careful to include everyone in the data set so that one person or thing is favored over another. This will prevent anything that can make the algorithm racist”.  The algorithm should be reassessed and should use different data sets that it may learn from.,15,15,30,40,"Yes, we think that 100 billion dollars is enough money to solve this problem in the U.S. We allocated the majority of the extra funding to the technological aspect because to create new datasets we would have to run a lot of more experiments and simulations in order to make it more representative of the real world demographic.

10/22/2021 16:55:21,D1-4,"Economics plays an important role in racism and decides the starting point of a person. Higher class has more knowledge and is being less discriminated against. We should end poverty first.  We can try to change it by trying to address the source of the unequal and discriminatory racism in poverty stricken areas. Which includes giving more funding to poor areas of the city and trying to desegregate communities between the poor and middle class.  Systemic change is required to address this issue, reform needs to happen in many places, including budget distribution, more information being made public, and outdated laws need to be updated to fit the modern age.","Racial biases are built into our society as there is gerrymandering that directly correlates to making votes a bit more unequal during counts. This puts communities at a disadvantage when voting for new electors and ultimately voting for different policy changes. And we can change the landscape of each zip code to be more diverse, rather than carrying one community.","We feel that they might have done so in a biased way to try and force more segregations. As by rating communities to be yellow or red, it makes them have less values, and they correlate minority communities directly in their results. Showing they may have done this with minorities in mind. And they can fix it by completely rewriting the algorithm and testing it among sample cases to check for biases in the algorithm.  One of the biggest inequalities in health care. We should try to expand the accessibility to basic health care to everyone","Provide free internet access to low-income families since a portion of them are in the minority groups. The Internet can educate people, so they can learn and connect to each other to find better ways to end racism. The algorithm developers did choose the proxy variable that had racial bias because they didn't put much effort in analyzing the effects of the racial bias. And their hospital code that analyzed people racial bias had already affected thousands before they even began to check the problems in their code. They can change it entirely and choose a new proxy variable within the code. And test it before releasing them.  Put more funding and budget into  local open access to technology like library computers, public internet access, and information.  Even if they choose a proxy variable, instead of having one set of data that is racially biased, the algorithm should include other sets of data to make it not as racially biased.  The proxy variable used to extract data is incredibly important to the overall implementation of an algorithm. Just as the output should be closely monitored by experienced individuals, the inputs should also be closely, if not more closely monitored and reassured to be accurate at accomplishing the intended goal before an algorithm is ever used.",10,20,35,35,We feel that it is not enough to just completely change the entire structural racism inputted on the society while also fulfilling the human and technological aspects. We need at least 1 trillion dollars to help and have a major effect in trying to prevent racism in America. We would allocate the majority of the extra funding to the structural aspect and a portion of funding towards the structural category. This is because these are the main problems that further reproduce racial problems. This is because the structural category affects through direct correlation to reproduce more racism throughout generations. It’s extremely difficult to know exactly what amount is required to accomplish this task because racism itself is hard to tackle and provide a feasible solution.
10/22/2021 16:58:35,D1-3,"“I think the first step to addressing racism is undertsanding how inequality, racism and discrimination were orignated and why people use them. Understanding is the first step to solving the problem.” The only way we can move forward in the algorithm and its data is understanding that we are all equal and what happened in the past should not continue in the future. The first step to solving this is, acting as a whole and working together to implement that this is the wrong way to live life. Doing certain events and hosting talks, etc can help change the history of racism and change it for the better. “ We cannot change what has happened in the past, but we can change what happens in the future.”",To change society on the structural level we need to look at the aspects and events that happen in their everyday lives“look towards basic aspects of society like education and the amount of socially funded events that are usually meant to boost a community.”. Racism comes at a disconnect from person to person. The solution I propose is simply having more connections from person to person. This can come mainly from social events and gatherings where we can not only share culture but share a conversation to help grow connections to people from all over the world. It has been shown through multiple interviews and recorded conversations that it is easier to badmouth a person you don’t know or haven’t spoken to.,"“By examining morals, we are able to go more in-depth as to why people choose to view others differently due to physical looks. By enforcing the idea and acknowledging why we are different from one another by physical aspects only, it should introduce a norm within society that the only difference we have is our own mentality. Morals are ever changing, it’s justified within itself that change is necessary to further understand our actions and beliefs. In a realistic environment, a movement is possible but impossible without force. To keep this appropriate, it would be wise to support / organize a movement to change the education system to become more individual-orientated rather than teaching. Being able to give such ideas and norms to younger audiences will allow for them to grow with the ideas. Essentially reforming the education system”","“Another thing the developer could do is look at the variable from multiple angles and get more of the full story so it's no longer biased but a collective of different perspectives and angles so it's a lot less biased than just one angle.” Essentially, you could have multiple different inputs for the data used in any algorithm so that the data, while not fully eliminating racism and bias, will still decreese it enough where it should make a huge difference. This could be created into an algorithm that can loop through the data and people and look at them in a more case by case sense rather than saying the data fits everyone.
