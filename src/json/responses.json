The execution of this would be to go to sources of information that people rely on the most, this would be social media, influencers, advertisements, and people that many respect such as celebrities. Then we would need to weed out the ones who are racist using some sort of test and find the most neutral ones. Then we would have to spam advertisements posts and have people sponsor messages that relate to equality and human rights. We would take experts on the topic of inequality and put them on the forefront of the movement and force people to listen to them because time and time again we have been shown that people would rather ignore a problem than face it.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

We can build this culture by disussing, exploring and educating ourselevs on racism. Additional training can be created by holding talks and workshops specific to racism.  The police force of the south was originally volunteers for catching runaway slaves. Thus they were highly racist group of people, and their legacy still exists within the police force.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums. We can solve this by having a mandate which requires schools to implement a program which speaks on the topic of racism and provide funding for research to aid in the development of a curriculum."

Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

From here, it is all about the implementation and creation of new programs, advertisements, and curriculum which can help us deviate away from a racist world. Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

Getting feedback from all the people that technologies impact is crucial because there tends to be a disconnect between them and those that create the technology, especially in the case of PredPol. In this case, the idea of predicting crime based on past data may have seemed like a good thing in the eyes of the police officers, but it may have seemed like bad news in the eyes of the people in the targeted communities.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

This is one of many things that the education system can do in order to decrease racial bias and racism as a whole. From here, it is all about the implementation and creation of new programs, advertisements, and curriculum which can help us deviate away from a racist world. Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums. We can solve this by having a mandate which requires schools to implement a program which speaks on the topic of racism and provide funding for research to aid in the development of a curriculum."

If that underlying decision is not appropriate then they can establish a three-tier system where the decision will be revised by three different people, so that the decision will be accurate and others will not think it as racially biased.  Sometimes people intentionally take underlying decisions to fulfill their own needs and greed. Other thing that can be done to resolve this is to eliminate the power of making final decision by a person in a program where discrimination is more likely to occur. Rather give those powers of making underlying decisions to a group of people or AI or any other technologies.Challenges: The group may have motives of their own that are fueled by their own greed, which might lead to conflict, or if the group were to collude for their own gains, it might lead to decisions being taken that might benefit them only  Solution: One way to fix this would be to let the decisions that the group stand for vote amongst the members affected by them, this would be the best way to eliminate biases.

Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. "

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

To change society's view on racism as a whole you need to make changes to society which will begin to switch people's personal values, some of which have been passed down for generations. Structural racism is a large problem which is within many parts of society today, it will be necessary to change all of these inequalities, ie a police officer being raised to discriminate against black americans and then going out and arresting black americans more often even when that person may not be doing anything wrong. To change this structural racism you will need to train officers not to discriminate against someone's race and specifically arrest someone based on the crimes they have committed. Also besides fixing structures in society which contain a larger amount of racial bias we need to have schools create a curriculum to teach children about race from a young age in order to try and start a new generation of children, most of which who may keep said values for the rest of their life and in turn teaching their children, starting a new cycle on less racism.

One example would be in the enlightenment era, where White people created documents in order to see if Black People were physically \"white\". It was unequal and discriminatory by the simple fact that each body is built differently and not everyone has the same skeleton structure. For structural racism, it would be with one of the videos, the last one, Dr. Khalil, he told history on how Black people were being criminalized through history by telling parallel history. Another example of structural racism in modern times would be the assassination of George Floyd, who was killed by a cop, Mr. Floyd said multiple times that he couldn't breathe but the cop didn't care. All of these are connected because they are police brutality, I think the way to tackle this is to train cops in a way where they don\u2019t pull up the gun without receiving information of the suspect they have. Maybe taking away guns and just giving them the tazers. More verbal warning rather than just taking out the gun while giving them a verbal warning this could heat up things more and the cop could shoot. "

If the people who made the underlying decisions are intentionally racially biased then there should be a repercussion and they should no longer be responsible for making these underlying decisions.

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

Another step that could be taken to change the fact that structural racism is produced overtime is building a more equitable culture. We can build this culture by disussing, exploring and educating ourselevs on racism. Additional training can be created by holding talks and workshops specific to racism.

These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news.

While it is valuable if the police officer was threatened by a gun, most Black Americans are subjected to aggressive force used by the police such as in the case of George Floyd. Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.  To combat the historical aspect of racism, there should be some form of racial bias education sessions mandated by all elementary schools and taught throughout the K-12 system.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

Having a society where everyone embraces each others' similarities and differences is a good starting point to prevent future racism.

One way to go about this is by having fun and/or informational programs which combine different groups of people.  Producing popular books and websites to help educate different cultures and traditions of different groups is another way to go about this."

The use of the American education system can be used in various ways to address racially biased decisions as children can be educated about diversity and inclusion which helps deviate from more racially biased beliefs. This is one of many things that the education system can do in order to decrease racial bias and racism as a whole. From here, it is all about the implementation and creation of new programs, advertisements, and curriculum which can help us deviate away from a racist world. Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums. We can solve this by having a mandate which requires schools to implement a program which speaks on the topic of racism and provide funding for research to aid in the development of a curriculum."

For policing specifically, there needs to be the abolishment of severe revamps in the idea of qualified immunity - the ability for police officers to act unlawful in an event that is \"out-of-line\". While it is valuable if the police officer was threatened by a gun, most Black Americans are subjected to aggressive force used by the police such as in the case of George Floyd. Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.  To combat the historical aspect of racism, there should be some form of racial bias education sessions mandated by all elementary schools and taught throughout the K-12 system. In hopes to maintain a community that does not actively have racial bias in the workforce, the training sessions should also exist in the workforce."

What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

This resulted in structural racism, or geographically divided cities based on race. One way to end the racism built into American society could be by increasing opportunities to those inside of the redlined neighborhoods. This could be through something such as offering more aid for the schools to provide the students with a better quality education, creating more students in search of professional careers, which would result in a higher income that would allow them to leave or improve upon their neighborhoods. This would lessen and eventually eradicate the structural divide in the nation amongst whites and minorities, resulting in more diverse neighborhoods which would lead to less racist arrests due it being harder to target one specific neighborhood with a minority majority.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

A source of quality education is a great way to help out the community in the long run since it was already a step behind. To be specific, the government could try to build at least 1-2 new schools in these areas. More structures like apartments, restaurants, medical centers, can provide the basic needs of people and can also provide new job opportunities.

Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. "

We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development.

I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

Even following the desegregation of public schools through the ruling of Brown v. Board in 1954, there have been large gaps between the academic success of African-Americans and white Americans. To alter this, America's public education system should be streamlined in order to level the playing field for all students.

I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them.

When the algorithm takes into account the reason for their proxy variable, for example, taking into account over policing in minority areas when looking at the amount of previous arrests made the algorithm can generate future crime hotspots by ensuring that over policing does not affect its decision."

This is so people who rent can instead become homeowners and thus have a more active involvement in the economy of the country.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

We can build this culture by disussing, exploring and educating ourselevs on racism. Additional training can be created by holding talks and workshops specific to racism.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

However overtime as time progressed color of skin had more and more to do with your skin color. Once christianity made it Immoral to have slaves, people began coming up with all types of justification to the superiority of their color vs another and that being the reason why they should not be allowed to advance and must be a slave or servant.

Knowing that this occurs, those responsible should have a diverse group of people check their work so they can get more opinions and viewpoints and catch the racial bias before it is public and affecting our society negatively.  If the people who made the underlying decisions are intentionally racially biased then there should be a repercussion and they should no longer be responsible for making these underlying decisions. To make change we also need to focus on where the people making these decisions get their information from because there is racial bias already built into our society so the racial bias may not come from them, but to change this we must try to eliminate racial bias from the information we receive. Doing that would be very difficult and take lots of time so we should also educate and train people making these underlying decisions to be able to detect racial bias to avoid them from using it in their works, like an algorithm."

We can start at the education level by ensuring education centers in poor minority areas are modernized and teach a well-rounded curriculum that inspires young students to grow into the person they wish to be. To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole. This incentive aid will break the generational cycle of families who rely on federal aid. "

Another example of structural racism in modern times would be the assassination of George Floyd, who was killed by a cop, Mr. Floyd said multiple times that he couldn't breathe but the cop didn't care. All of these are connected because they are police brutality, I think the way to tackle this is to train cops in a way where they don\u2019t pull up the gun without receiving information of the suspect they have.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them.

To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development.

I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

Knowing that this occurs, those responsible should have a diverse group of people check their work so they can get more opinions and viewpoints and catch the racial bias before it is public and affecting our society negatively.

Another way we can address this issue is to increase the budget of our police will cause our policing forces to be better equipped by re-training our current officers and establishing new training protocols to ensure that all of our new officers from there on can satisfactorily complete their jobs, and in the event of arrests and legal decisions, use no racial bias. This will also lead to a more accurate representation of our crime data through removal of racially biased decisions in our justice system, effectively making it easier to pinpoint where actual crime lies rather than accused crime through racial profiling."

However overtime as time progressed color of skin had more and more to do with your skin color. Once christianity made it Immoral to have slaves, people began coming up with all types of justification to the superiority of their color vs another and that being the reason why they should not be allowed to advance and must be a slave or servant.

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities.

Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. "

To attempt to fix this, the government can provide more funding to these areas instead of continuously providing the rich with more unnecessary funds. Giving more attention to schools in these neighborhoods could help benefit the future. A source of quality education is a great way to help out the community in the long run since it was already a step behind. To be specific, the government could try to build at least 1-2 new schools in these areas. More structures like apartments, restaurants, medical centers, can provide the basic needs of people and can also provide new job opportunities.

Another example of structural racism in modern times would be the assassination of George Floyd, who was killed by a cop, Mr. Floyd said multiple times that he couldn't breathe but the cop didn't care. All of these are connected because they are police brutality, I think the way to tackle this is to train cops in a way where they don\u2019t pull up the gun without receiving information of the suspect they have. Maybe taking away guns and just giving them the tazers. More verbal warning rather than just taking out the gun while giving them a verbal warning this could heat up things more and the cop could shoot. "

What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

Structural or systemic racism exists in all different types of work places and racial equity is at the heart of many of these work places. This occurs when equal opportunities are given to people of all races at institutions. Having this racial equity and having people of color lead and serve will address the issue of structural racism. Another step that could be taken to change the fact that structural racism is produced overtime is building a more equitable culture. We can build this culture by disussing, exploring and educating ourselevs on racism. Additional training can be created by holding talks and workshops specific to racism.  The police force of the south was originally volunteers for catching runaway slaves. Thus they were highly racist group of people, and their legacy still exists within the police force.    Criminal data has been collected since racism was common concept. And today's analytics result in biases because we use the data that was collected based on racist policy years ago. "

One example would be in the enlightenment era, where White people created documents in order to see if Black People were physically \"white\". It was unequal and discriminatory by the simple fact that each body is built differently and not everyone has the same skeleton structure. For structural racism, it would be with one of the videos, the last one, Dr. Khalil, he told history on how Black people were being criminalized through history by telling parallel history. Another example of structural racism in modern times would be the assassination of George Floyd, who was killed by a cop, Mr. Floyd said multiple times that he couldn't breathe but the cop didn't care. All of these are connected because they are police brutality, I think the way to tackle this is to train cops in a way where they don\u2019t pull up the gun without receiving information of the suspect they have. Maybe taking away guns and just giving them the tazers. More verbal warning rather than just taking out the gun while giving them a verbal warning this could heat up things more and the cop could shoot. "

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

Following the abolition of slavery, African Americans were met with harsh discrimination and faced new hurdles like  Jim Crow Laws and additional systems meant to oppress black communities. Even following the desegregation of public schools through the ruling of Brown v. Board in 1954, there have been large gaps between the academic success of African-Americans and white Americans. To alter this, America's public education system should be streamlined in order to level the playing field for all students. Schools should receive equal funding, have the same curriculum, and offer easily accessible resources to students. The academic success of students drives their futures. Enhancing the education received by black communities will promote better economic/socio economic standings for black americans."

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

The cycle must be broken, and to achieve this we must start at the very bottom and work our way up. This change will take a lot of time, but is the only foreseeable way to ensure the cycle is completely broken. We can start at the education level by ensuring education centers in poor minority areas are modernized and teach a well-rounded curriculum that inspires young students to grow into the person they wish to be. To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole. This incentive aid will break the generational cycle of families who rely on federal aid. "

Knowing that this occurs, those responsible should have a diverse group of people check their work so they can get more opinions and viewpoints and catch the racial bias before it is public and affecting our society negatively.  If the people who made the underlying decisions are intentionally racially biased then there should be a repercussion and they should no longer be responsible for making these underlying decisions. To make change we also need to focus on where the people making these decisions get their information from because there is racial bias already built into our society so the racial bias may not come from them, but to change this we must try to eliminate racial bias from the information we receive. Doing that would be very difficult and take lots of time so we should also educate and train people making these underlying decisions to be able to detect racial bias to avoid them from using it in their works, like an algorithm."

Even following the desegregation of public schools through the ruling of Brown v. Board in 1954, there have been large gaps between the academic success of African-Americans and white Americans. To alter this, America's public education system should be streamlined in order to level the playing field for all students.

Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. "

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data. One might argue that this just shifts the problem from one algorithm to another, but in this case,  it might be effective to fight fire with fire. "

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.

If the people who made the underlying decisions are intentionally racially biased then there should be a repercussion and they should no longer be responsible for making these underlying decisions. To make change we also need to focus on where the people making these decisions get their information from because there is racial bias already built into our society so the racial bias may not come from them, but to change this we must try to eliminate racial bias from the information we receive. Doing that would be very difficult and take lots of time so we should also educate and train people making these underlying decisions to be able to detect racial bias to avoid them from using it in their works, like an algorithm."

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

The reason why it is so difficult for racism to go away, is that it has been embedded into American society at such a deep level. Adults/teachers must not be racist when teaching the next generations, which is extremely difficult. I believe that educating the teachers that do not understand right and wrong, is one of the ways we can change the fact that racial biases are built into our society at a structural level.

To change this structural racism you will need to train officers not to discriminate against someone's race and specifically arrest someone based on the crimes they have committed. Also besides fixing structures in society which contain a larger amount of racial bias we need to have schools create a curriculum to teach children about race from a young age in order to try and start a new generation of children, most of which who may keep said values for the rest of their life and in turn teaching their children, starting a new cycle on less racism.

To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole.

American cops have been unrightfully arrested and accused black people with charges for the crimes they haven't even done.

Even following the desegregation of public schools through the ruling of Brown v. Board in 1954, there have been large gaps between the academic success of African-Americans and white Americans. To alter this, America's public education system should be streamlined in order to level the playing field for all students. Schools should receive equal funding, have the same curriculum, and offer easily accessible resources to students. The academic success of students drives their futures.

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities.

By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. "

Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums.

To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it.

These can help in our society where those who are most privileged and successful usually have a history of generational wealth. It may get hard to get funding. "

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

Based on the concept of separate but equal, the students are treated equally even though they are separated. However, this was not the case since the quality of the schools was not comparable; black schools were in disrepair with dreadful classrooms in comparison to white schools, which had all of their equipment up to date. Nowadays, schools are not divided based on race; however, black pupils do not receive the same level of education as white students. One method for addressing racism in schools is to involve the community, whether it is local residents or community organizations, so that they may join together and make decisions to help improve the school. They can, for example, engage with instructors to offer chances for both black and white kids to study and collaborate on projects. Teachers can also teach these students about racism's history."

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data. One might argue that this just shifts the problem from one algorithm to another, but in this case,  it might be effective to fight fire with fire. "

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

This could be through something such as offering more aid for the schools to provide the students with a better quality education, creating more students in search of professional careers, which would result in a higher income that would allow them to leave or improve upon their neighborhoods. This would lessen and eventually eradicate the structural divide in the nation amongst whites and minorities, resulting in more diverse neighborhoods which would lead to less racist arrests due it being harder to target one specific neighborhood with a minority majority.

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

Based on the concept of separate but equal, the students are treated equally even though they are separated. However, this was not the case since the quality of the schools was not comparable; black schools were in disrepair with dreadful classrooms in comparison to white schools, which had all of their equipment up to date. Nowadays, schools are not divided based on race; however, black pupils do not receive the same level of education as white students. One method for addressing racism in schools is to involve the community, whether it is local residents or community organizations, so that they may join together and make decisions to help improve the school. They can, for example, engage with instructors to offer chances for both black and white kids to study and collaborate on projects. Teachers can also teach these students about racism's history."

To change this structural racism you will need to train officers not to discriminate against someone's race and specifically arrest someone based on the crimes they have committed. Also besides fixing structures in society which contain a larger amount of racial bias we need to have schools create a curriculum to teach children about race from a young age in order to try and start a new generation of children, most of which who may keep said values for the rest of their life and in turn teaching their children, starting a new cycle on less racism.

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there.

Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families.

It turned out that resumes with white names were 50 percent more likely to be invited for an interview than those with black names. That doesn't necessarily mean corporate HR managers are racist. It is likely that they do not consciously reject black names on their resumes, but because of subconscious bias. So my solution is that people need to think about whether a decision makes sense before they make it. You can't be racist because of some subconscious point of view. What the government needs to do is to ensure that everyone has equal access to police and education."

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

We can build this culture by disussing, exploring and educating ourselevs on racism. Additional training can be created by holding talks and workshops specific to racism.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

This is one of many things that the education system can do in order to decrease racial bias and racism as a whole. From here, it is all about the implementation and creation of new programs, advertisements, and curriculum which can help us deviate away from a racist world. Challenges that we might face implementing this solution is creating an entirely new curriculum and having schools implement these curriculums. We can solve this by having a mandate which requires schools to implement a program which speaks on the topic of racism and provide funding for research to aid in the development of a curriculum."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development.

I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

Documents or programs could be made to guid and remind developers on how to keep their code unbiased.   Another way we can address this issue is to increase the budget of our police will cause our policing forces to be better equipped by re-training our current officers and establishing new training protocols to ensure that all of our new officers from there on can satisfactorily complete their jobs, and in the event of arrests and legal decisions, use no racial bias. This will also lead to a more accurate representation of our crime data through removal of racially biased decisions in our justice system, effectively making it easier to pinpoint where actual crime lies rather than accused crime through racial profiling."

Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news.

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.

Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news.

For example, black males in America are more than 5 times as likely than white males in Americans to say they have been unjustifiably stopped by the police. This is concrete evidence that black males in America are at a disadvantage with the police who are supposed to protect us.  You can't change the fact that \"American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, and structural racism is reproduced over time,\" but in addressing the situation in order to provide a solution we could try to encourage inclusion of all communities. In the video, \"Does My Neighborhood Determine My Future,\" Professor Jacob Faber explains how segregation during the 20th century has prevented people of color, especially African-Americans, from many opportunities that would have improved their lives. Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

For policing specifically, there needs to be the abolishment of severe revamps in the idea of qualified immunity - the ability for police officers to act unlawful in an event that is \"out-of-line\". While it is valuable if the police officer was threatened by a gun, most Black Americans are subjected to aggressive force used by the police such as in the case of George Floyd. Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.  To combat the historical aspect of racism, there should be some form of racial bias education sessions mandated by all elementary schools and taught throughout the K-12 system. In hopes to maintain a community that does not actively have racial bias in the workforce, the training sessions should also exist in the workforce."

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them.

We could create this change by collecting new data by not over policing in areas and getting an accurate reading of where crime is and where we need police officers more, not just in primarily black communities. A potential challenge that we might face is allowing human bias to interfere with the new data being collected and allowing that to be put into the algorithm which can then cause over policing in areas that were caused by human bias in certain areas."

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data. One might argue that this just shifts the problem from one algorithm to another, but in this case,  it might be effective to fight fire with fire. "

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

Another way we can address this issue is to increase the budget of our police will cause our policing forces to be better equipped by re-training our current officers and establishing new training protocols to ensure that all of our new officers from there on can satisfactorily complete their jobs, and in the event of arrests and legal decisions, use no racial bias. This will also lead to a more accurate representation of our crime data through removal of racially biased decisions in our justice system, effectively making it easier to pinpoint where actual crime lies rather than accused crime through racial profiling."

For those who didn't know they were being biased they need to be more aware of their surroundings and make decisions to better themselves and better our society, this can also be solved through better education and more training. In addition to training, more time should be allocated towards implicit bias training and less on shooting practice since police officers are the main source of human bias due to their power to arrest. This will expose them to their implicit biases and hope to dramatically reduce or even eliminate discriminatory behavior.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

The surveys would show information to see the wages between employees and would show the diversity of the workplace as well as wages and each employee's skill sets. It would also have information about those who applied to be hired.

Following the abolition of slavery, African Americans were met with harsh discrimination and faced new hurdles like  Jim Crow Laws and additional systems meant to oppress black communities. Even following the desegregation of public schools through the ruling of Brown v. Board in 1954, there have been large gaps between the academic success of African-Americans and white Americans. To alter this, America's public education system should be streamlined in order to level the playing field for all students. Schools should receive equal funding, have the same curriculum, and offer easily accessible resources to students. The academic success of students drives their futures. Enhancing the education received by black communities will promote better economic/socio economic standings for black americans."

Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

While it is valuable if the police officer was threatened by a gun, most Black Americans are subjected to aggressive force used by the police such as in the case of George Floyd. Removing the immunity would hold the police and the departments liable for any acts that can be considered discriminatory and over the top. While this does not stop the racial bias in PredPol or the policies' discriminatory behavior, it would hold them accountable which to some extent, may help aid in the creation of less structural racism.  To combat the historical aspect of racism, there should be some form of racial bias education sessions mandated by all elementary schools and taught throughout the K-12 system.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

Nowadays, schools are not divided based on race; however, black pupils do not receive the same level of education as white students. One method for addressing racism in schools is to involve the community, whether it is local residents or community organizations, so that they may join together and make decisions to help improve the school. They can, for example, engage with instructors to offer chances for both black and white kids to study and collaborate on projects. Teachers can also teach these students about racism's history."

Another example of structural racism in modern times would be the assassination of George Floyd, who was killed by a cop, Mr. Floyd said multiple times that he couldn't breathe but the cop didn't care. All of these are connected because they are police brutality, I think the way to tackle this is to train cops in a way where they don\u2019t pull up the gun without receiving information of the suspect they have.

A combination of multiple different ways is the best approach for this problem. Firstly, the data that is fed into the algorithm must be checked and corrected for racial bias. What if we create a machine learning algorithm that does this automatically for us? We could manually correct a large set of data, feed it into the \u201cbias-removal\u201d algorithm and teach it to remove biases. After that algorithm does its work, we can feed the sanitized data into the policing algorithm. This solution appears to be more cost effective than manually removing the bias in all sets of data.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

We think a review group would help to review data and identify elements where bias is noted in a specific cases and remove cases from the dataset where bias is evident.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

For example, black males in America are more than 5 times as likely than white males in Americans to say they have been unjustifiably stopped by the police. This is concrete evidence that black males in America are at a disadvantage with the police who are supposed to protect us.  You can't change the fact that \"American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, and structural racism is reproduced over time,\" but in addressing the situation in order to provide a solution we could try to encourage inclusion of all communities. In the video, \"Does My Neighborhood Determine My Future,\" Professor Jacob Faber explains how segregation during the 20th century has prevented people of color, especially African-Americans, from many opportunities that would have improved their lives. Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

No matter what we do in the society/structures, history, and technological elements of this problem, nothing will change if everyone isn't willing to change with it. To that end, a way we could solve the human problem of racism would be to change people's disillusions about race and inform them about human equality and how to respect other people.  The execution of this would be to go to sources of information that people rely on the most, this would be social media, influencers, advertisements, and people that many respect such as celebrities. Then we would need to weed out the ones who are racist using some sort of test and find the most neutral ones. Then we would have to spam advertisements posts and have people sponsor messages that relate to equality and human rights. We would take experts on the topic of inequality and put them on the forefront of the movement and force people to listen to them because time and time again we have been shown that people would rather ignore a problem than face it. By forcing people to face the issues in society they would need to admit that there are problems that exist and would eventually subconsciously or consciously make decisions that would help in the fight against racism."

It will take a long time for racist ideas to stop being passed through generations. However, with activism like the Black Lives Matter movement, people can begin to recognize their flaws and change for the better. Activism helps bring awareness to more and more people, which may in time, lessen the effects of historical racism by discouraging racist ideas in those who have been touched by the movement. I think it's important to recognize who you are in terms of race, but I also think it's important to recognize that being part of a culture does not mean other cultures are inferior. Some cultures seem to have other cultures being inferior as a part of its identity and that's one of the main things we need to target. I feel like that fact needs to be called out more. Some potential challenges include counter-protests or news spinning the situation to something harmful.  These challenges can be overcome by having a designated spokesperson who can speak out against the wrong news and spread the real message behind the protests. Also, having a page where people can post true information about protests allows for the negation of misinformation by the news. Counter-protests will never be fully negated, but spreading activist ideas faster than the counterpart will make ones argument more powerful. "

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

We can start at the education level by ensuring education centers in poor minority areas are modernized and teach a well-rounded curriculum that inspires young students to grow into the person they wish to be. To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole.

Another way we can address this issue is to increase the budget of our police will cause our policing forces to be better equipped by re-training our current officers and establishing new training protocols to ensure that all of our new officers from there on can satisfactorily complete their jobs, and in the event of arrests and legal decisions, use no racial bias.

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

The cycle must be broken, and to achieve this we must start at the very bottom and work our way up. This change will take a lot of time, but is the only foreseeable way to ensure the cycle is completely broken. We can start at the education level by ensuring education centers in poor minority areas are modernized and teach a well-rounded curriculum that inspires young students to grow into the person they wish to be. To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole. This incentive aid will break the generational cycle of families who rely on federal aid. "

The developers of the system can make the system update new data constantly every day, and make predictions based on continuous new data rather than rigid predictions based on collected data.    I think if the police prediction system can become smarter, you can effectively reduce the conflict between the police and people of color, as you all know, the police often predict high-risk area to the patrol system, under the condition of the imperfect system prediction, usually there will be many colored people live in this area, but this does not mean that the region is at a high risk. However, the results given by the system can lead the police to think that this is a high-risk area, so there is a risk that the police will patrol with this sentiment, and people of color will feel uncomfortable because their neighborhoods are often patrolled by the police. Over time, there are bound to be conflicts and unnecessary accidents. However, with better prediction systems, police can predict risk areas more rationally, thus reducing unnecessary losses. My solution optimizes and improves the police forecasting system, enabling police to patrol better and reduce unnecessary losses. It also creates more trust in the police system, rather than fear or unease about police action. People of color also think that the police are patrolling the streets and not trying to suppress them. The analytics for high risk areas, they result in a over policing for colored and the opposite for whites. Thus there is some influence in the algorithm that derives racial profiling."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias. This could involve training thousands of people to survey neighborhoods and diagnose problems to be solved."

Structural or systemic racism exists in all different types of work places and racial equity is at the heart of many of these work places. This occurs when equal opportunities are given to people of all races at institutions. Having this racial equity and having people of color lead and serve will address the issue of structural racism. Another step that could be taken to change the fact that structural racism is produced overtime is building a more equitable culture. We can build this culture by disussing, exploring and educating ourselevs on racism. Additional training can be created by holding talks and workshops specific to racism.  The police force of the south was originally volunteers for catching runaway slaves. Thus they were highly racist group of people, and their legacy still exists within the police force.    Criminal data has been collected since racism was common concept. And today's analytics result in biases because we use the data that was collected based on racist policy years ago. "

Knowing that this occurs, those responsible should have a diverse group of people check their work so they can get more opinions and viewpoints and catch the racial bias before it is public and affecting our society negatively.  If the people who made the underlying decisions are intentionally racially biased then there should be a repercussion and they should no longer be responsible for making these underlying decisions. To make change we also need to focus on where the people making these decisions get their information from because there is racial bias already built into our society so the racial bias may not come from them, but to change this we must try to eliminate racial bias from the information we receive. Doing that would be very difficult and take lots of time so we should also educate and train people making these underlying decisions to be able to detect racial bias to avoid them from using it in their works, like an algorithm."

The cycle must be broken, and to achieve this we must start at the very bottom and work our way up. This change will take a lot of time, but is the only foreseeable way to ensure the cycle is completely broken. We can start at the education level by ensuring education centers in poor minority areas are modernized and teach a well-rounded curriculum that inspires young students to grow into the person they wish to be. To ensure education remains a top priority at these schools we can implement types of positions that ensure the safety of education atmospheres and denounce crime related activity. Once the education level plan is intact it must be monitored and consistently altered to fit the active world's society and top understanding. After this we may move onto aid. Aid must be given out to those who absolutely need it. In the aid we should implement growth incentives to ensure that the people who are receiving aid are growing and putting themselves into valuable positions in society that not only hold value to them, but society as a whole. This incentive aid will break the generational cycle of families who rely on federal aid. "

This is concrete evidence that black males in America are at a disadvantage with the police who are supposed to protect us.  You can't change the fact that \"American society has been historically unequal and discriminatory, and structural racism is reproduced over time,\" but in addressing the situation in order to provide a solution we could try to encourage inclusion of all communities. In the video, \"Does My Neighborhood Determine My Future,\" Professor Jacob Faber explains how segregation during the 20th century has prevented people of color, especially African-Americans, from many opportunities that would have improved their lives. Even though segregation is banned now however, its effects still linger within a lot of neighborhoods and impact the level of development there. Therefore, a solution to eradicate America's structural racism would be to give back what was taken away at the very beginning- opportunities and amenities. Provide proper housing and adequate resources to schools where the majority of students are people of color and come from low-income families. By doing this, people could use these resources to educate themselves and achieve numerous goals that will hopefully give them a better life."

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

One of the documents provided by these real estate appraisers describing the neighborhoods that were surveyed said the area is well laid out and improvements are attractive, but the proximity of negro families on Spruce St caused the score to suffer. At the southern edge precludes the district from a better rating, and is retarding its development. These real estate appraisers were deliberately giving lower scores to neighborhoods that had even the slightest relations with African Americans, ultimately causing these people to have significantly worse living situations, no home loan funds or insurance, despite some of them not having any kind of economic risks to the banks. I believe that one way we can help address this problem is to not allow race to be a factor when determining the ratings of these neighborhoods, being that essentially the main reason several neighborhoods were redlined was due to the heavy concentration of minorities and more specifically negros, we can conclude that these maps should no longer be considered an accurate way of measuring the economic status of these neighborhoods, and we have to institute a re-evaluation of these neighborhoods in order to acquire more accurate results without racial bias.

We could teach children to be more accepting and understanding to people of a different race to eliminate the racism built up by their parents and their upbringing. We could also monitor the amount of hate speech on social media. There should also be more representation of minorities on major media platforms so people are exposed to diversity."

With this, it could potentially lead to dramatic changes such as the passing of laws dealing with discrimination and racism. For example, when slavery was built into our society at a structural level, activists were fighting and promoting change continuously. Because of this, laws such as the Emancipation Proclamation was passed, abolishing slavery for good. Overall, the act of promoting can heavily address the fact that racial biases and discrimination are built into our society at a structural level. Another way we could attack racism and discriminaition at a structural level is by controlling social media in a way that punishes people for putting out any propaganda or rumors that could further deepen the racial divide."

We would also address this by making sure the police officers who are giving information for the algorithms don't have any racial biases, by also doing background checks on social media accounts and if they have been punished for excessive use of force against people of color. Another policy to add would be a statistic only policy for the data being submitted, and the data would be required to pass a verified statistic only test."

No matter what we do in the society/structures, history, and technological elements of this problem, nothing will change if everyone isn't willing to change with it. To that end, a way we could solve the human problem of racism would be to change people's disillusions about race and inform them about human equality and how to respect other people.  The execution of this would be to go to sources of information that people rely on the most, this would be social media, influencers, advertisements, and people that many respect such as celebrities. Then we would need to weed out the ones who are racist using some sort of test and find the most neutral ones. Then we would have to spam advertisements posts and have people sponsor messages that relate to equality and human rights. We would take experts on the topic of inequality and put them on the forefront of the movement and force people to listen to them because time and time again we have been shown that people would rather ignore a problem than face it. By forcing people to face the issues in society they would need to admit that there are problems that exist and would eventually subconsciously or consciously make decisions that would help in the fight against racism."

For example, with the death of George Floyd, his death was shown across all of social media so everyone knew about the situation. But that does not happen to everyone that falls victim to racial bias. Almost everyone, especially kids of younger age, use social media. So if we show these issues on these social media platforms, the kids that are using them can see what actually happens and learn so they do not grow up with a racial bias. Potential challenges would be getting these social media companies to actually comply and spread the word of racial bias to their users. But I feel like it would happen like a domino effect, once one company starts doing it then more will join in."
